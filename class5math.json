But as you do them, I want you to really keep in mind and think about what the carrying actually means. So I assume you've tried it on your own. Now I'll work through them with you. So we have 9 plus 6. 9 ones plus 6 ones. Well 9 plus 6 is 15. Well, we can write the 5 in the ones place, and then we can carry the one. But what did we just do? W.hat does this 1 represent? Well, we put it in the tens place-- one 10 represents 10. So all we've said is that 9 plus 6 is equal to 10 plus 5. Is equal to one 10 plus 5, which is equal to 15. Now, in the tens place, we have 1 plus 0 plus 9 which is 10.. So we can write 0 and carry the 1 1 plus 0 plus 9 is 10. Now what does that really mean? Well this is 1 ten plus 0 tens plus 9 tens, which is 10 tens. 10 tens is 100. Or another way to think about 100, it's 1 hundred, and 0 tens. So that's all that carrying represents. So now we have a 1, plus a 7, plus a 9. That is going to be 17. Now we have to remind ourselves, this is in the hundreds place. This is actually 1 hundred plus 7 hundred plus 9 hundred 17 hundred. Or 1 thousand, 7 hundred. And of course we have this 5 here. And we are done. Now let's try to tackle this one. Now the reason why I wrote it that way is to make sure that we remind ourselves to align the proper places under the appropriate places. So this we rewrite as-- let me do that same green color-- we could rewrite this as 373 plus-- we want to write the ones place under the ones place, and the tens place under the tens place, so that we're adding the appropriate values. So 3 plus 8 is 11. The 1 in the ones place, and the 1 in the tens place. 10 plus 1 is 11. 1 plus 7 is 8. 8 plus 8 is 16. This is actually 16 tens. So let me just write down the 16. What is 16 tens? Well, that's 160. So this 6 is a 60, and then I have a hundred. 1 plus 3 is 4. But these are actually hundreds, so it's 4 hundreds. So we get 461. Now finally, 9 plus 3 is 12. 2 ones, and 1 ten. 12 is the same thing as 10 plus 2. Now in the tens place, 1 plus 4 plus 9 is 14. So we write the 4, and carry the 1. But remind ourselves this is actually 10 plus 40 plus 90, which is 140. Which is the same thing as 40 plus 100. And then 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4. But this is the hundreds place. So this is actually 1 hundred, plus 1 hundred, plus 2 hundred, or 4 hundred. And we're done.",

So we're going to add 40,762 to 30,473. And you can pause the video and try to solve it on your own, but I encourage you to watch this one because it's really about understanding how things happen. So what I'm going to do is first, think of this in terms of place value. So let me write out my place values, let's see, this goes all the way up to the ten thousands place. So let's see ten thousands and then we have a thousands, then we have a hundreds-- I could write these words out but this is a little bit faster to write it this way. And then we could have a tens place and then we can have a ones place. I wanna do that in a different color. So then we have a ones place. Let me make a table here and I'm gonna express both of these numbers in terms of ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones and then I'm gonna, at the same time, use what's sometimes known as the standard method or the standard algorithm. Algorithm is a fancy word for a system, a way of doing something. But let's first represent these numbers. Here I have four ten thousands. One, two, three, four. Here I have three ten thousands. One, two, three, I'm gonna add these two together eventually. In both of these numbers, I have zero thousands, so I have nothing in this column right now. Here, I have seven hundreds. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Here I have four hundreds. One, two, three, four. Then I go to the tens place, here I have six tens. One, two, three, four, five, six. Here I have seven tens. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then last, but not least, here I have two ones. One, two. And here I have three ones. One, two, three. Now, let's just rewrite this number up here, this is four ten thousands, so this is forty thousand, I have zero thousands. Right over there. And then I have seven hundreths. Seven hundreds. I have six tens. Six tens. And I have two ones. I'm just rewriting the number, but let me write the tens in that blue color. So six tens and then two ones. Having trouble switching colors. Two ones. So there you have it. This and this are just different ways of representing the same number and then this down here, I have three ten thousands, and then I have zero thousands, I have four hundreds here and then I have seven tens, seven tens, and then I have three ones. And so now, let's add up everything. So I can add it here and then I can also add up things right over here. So in the standard method, we would start at the lowest place, and we'd say okay, two ones plus three ones is equal to five ones, and similarly, two ones plus three ones would be one, two, three, four, five ones. Fair enough, nothing fancy there. Now let's go to the tens place. Well, in the tens place we have six tens plus seven tens, and in the standard method what you say is, \"that's 13 tens,\" but 13 tens is the same thing as three tens and one hundred. So what you do is, you would regroup. You would say, \"hey look, this is three tens \"and one hundreds.\" Sometimes people say, \"Oh you're carrying the one. \"Six plus seven is 13, carry the one.\" And it seems somewhat magical, but all you're doing is you're taking ten of the tens and you're regrouping it as a hundred. It'll be a little clearer here. So we have six tens and then we have seven tens, you add 'em all together, you get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen tens. All we're doing right over is we're saying, \"Look this is equal to a hundred.\" So let's just convert that into a hundred right over here. Let's just convert that and so what we do is, we just write the three in the tens place and then we add an extra one in the hundreds place. And so what are we gonna have in the hundreds place now? And actually, let me do it here because it's a little more interesting. So I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve hundreds. So I can write 'em down here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and twelve, but with the same thing, we don't have a digit for the number twelve in our traditional number system, so what I could do is I could take ten of these and I can convert is to a thousand. So I'm gonna take ten of those and give myself a thousand. No we're gonna do the exact same thing over here. One plus seven plus four is twelve. So you'd write-- That's two hundreds because this is twelve hundreds, that's two hundreds plus a thousand, so we just regrouped again. Now in the thousands place, one plus zero plus zero is one thousand and you see that right over here, you have one thousand. And then finally, in the ten thousands place, four ten thousands plus three ten thousands is seven ten thousands. Four ten thousands plus three ten thousands is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven ten thousands. And so this number is 71,235. 71,235. So hopefully it all makes sense how these two things will fit together. That what's going on over here-- You're not just magically carrying numbers or magically regrouping, you're just representing the same number in different ways.",

        "transcript": "So let's subtract 286 from 913. But first I'm going to do it in a slightly different way. I've taken each of these numbers, and I've expanded them out. This 9 in the hundreds place represents 900. This 1 in the tens place represents 10. This 3 in the ones place represents 3. Likewise, 286 is the same thing as 200 plus 80 plus 6. So let's try to subtract going place by place. So if we start in the ones place, we have a problem immediately. 3 is less than 6. How do we subtract a larger number from a smaller number? We also have a problem in the tens place, 80 is larger than 10. How do we subtract a larger number from a smaller number? And you might guess the answer here is regrouping, sometimes called borrowing. We're going to take value from one place and give it to another. So let's say this scenario right over here, where we have this 3, and we want to take some value from one of the other places. Well, I could take 10 from the tens place, so then this is going to become 0. And if I give that 10 to the ones place, so 10 plus 3 is 13. Notice I haven't changed the value. 900 plus 0 plus 13 is still 913. Now, this solved the problem for the ones place. I can now subtract 6 from 13. But it made the problem in the tens place even worse. I now have to subtract 80 from 0. What do I do? Well, luckily, I can go to the hundreds place. I could take 100 from 900, so then I'm left with 800. And I could you give it to the tens place. So if I give it to the tens place, then this is going to be 100. Notice this still adds up to 913. 800 plus 100 plus 13 is 913. Why is this valuable? Well, now in every column, I'm subtracting a smaller number from a larger. You might say, wait, isn't there a positive sign here? But we have this negative out here. So we're subtracting 6 from 13. We're subtracting 80 from 100, subtracting 200 from 800. So let's do it. 13 minus 6 is 7. 100 minus 80 is 20. 800 minus 200 is 600. So we're left with 600 plus 20 plus 7, which is 627. Now let's do the exact same thing here, but we're not going to expand out the numbers. So 6 is greater than 3, what do we do? Well, we can regroup from the tens place. We can take 10 from here so we're left with 0 tens and give that 1 ten to the ones place. So you give 10 to the 3, it becomes 13. But now we have a problem in the tens place. How do we subtract 8 from 0? Well, we could take 100 from the hundreds place, so 900 becomes 800, and give that 100 to the tens place. So you give the 100 to the tens place, 100 plus 0 tens is 100. 100 is the same thing as 10 tens. And so now we are ready to subtract. 13 minus 6 is 7, 10 minus 8 is 2. Remember, this is really 10 tens minus 8 tens to get 2 tens. 100 minus 80 to get 20. And then finally, we have 800 minus 200 to get 600-- 627.",

        "transcript": "- [Instructor] What we're gonna do in this video is figure out what 389,002 minus 76,151 is. Like always, I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure it out on your own. That's the best way to really, even if you're not able to figure out, or if you get a different answer, then when I work through it with you it will really stick in your brain that much more. Alright, now let's work through it together. The way I'm gonna do it is sometimes called the standard method or the standard algorithm, algorithm being a fancy word for a method. What I'm gonna do is first write the 389,002. 389,002. And I'm subtracting 76,151. You notice the first thing that I did is I aligned the digits to the appropriate place value. I put the ones below the ones. The 10s below the 10s, the 100s below the 100s, the 1,000s below the 1,000s, the 10,000s below the 10,000s, so on and so forth. And now we're ready to subtract. So the first thing we might do is well, let's look at the ones place. Here I have two ones, and I'm gonna take away one one. So I'm gonna be left with one one. That was pretty straightforward. But then things get a little bit more difficult when we get to the 10s place. How do I take five 10s from zero 10s? So let me just not think about that for a second, but I have the same problem in the 100s place. How do I take away one 100 from zero 100s? Now when I go to the 1,000s place, I can take away six 1,000s from nine 1,000s, but before I do that what I want to do is regroup so that I don't have zeros here so that I can take away from the 100s and the 10s place. And so what I can do is I can rewrite nine 1,000s, so I'm gonna take away one of those 1,000s, so I'm gonna have eight 1,000s. And I'm gonna regroup it as 10 100s. So this can be that 1,000 would be 10 100s. Now that solves a problem, except for the 10s place. But what I can then do is I could take away one of those 100s so I only have nine 100s now, and I could regroup that extra 100 as 10 10s. So as 10 10s. And now I can keep subtracting. So in the 10s place, 10 10s minus five 10s, is five 10s. I go to the 100s place, nine 100s minus 100 is 800. I go to the 1,000s place. 8,000 minus 6,000 is 2,000. And then I can go to the 10,000s place. This is essentially eight 10,000s, or 80,000 minus 70,000 is going to be 10,000. One 10,000. And then last but not least, I have my three 100,000s. So there you go. We're done. This is 312,851. This is the standard method. I started at the ones place. Sometimes it's good to just do a check to make sure every digit on top in the appropriate place is at least equal to the digit that you're subtracting from it. And so you can do the regrouping ahead of time. But either way, you will end up with a similar process.",

When the bottom number is bigger we subtract in the reverse order but put a bar over the digit in the answer. Bar digits can be thought of as negative digits!\n\nWe then convert from bar digits to a normal number using the following steps:\n\n1) For each group of one or more 0\u2019s (if any) immediately to the left of a group of one or more bar digits, we also put bars on those 0\u2019s.\n\n2) For each group of bar digits after the previous step:\n\na) We subtract \u201call from 9 except last from 10\u201d.\n\nb) We take away 1 from the digit immediately to the left of the group of bar digits.\n\nThis might seem hard to understand at first, but it should become easier to understand when you read the example below.\n\nExample: 676,354,508 - 146,378,168.\n\nWe could go right to left, or left to right.

            "4:25": "That's 10 tens which is hundreds.",

            "4:35": "This 962 is the exact same thing as that 962",
            "4:39": "right over there.",
            "4:40": "Why?",
            "4:41": "Well because we multiplied the 200 times the one,",
            "4:44": "times the 80, times the 400.",
            "4:47": "We saw that over here,",
            "4:48": "and then we just added 'em all together to be 962.",
            "4:50": "That's all the standard algorithm did just now.",
            "4:53": "And then we move over to the five.",
            "4:55": "But this is really five tens or 50,",
            "4:58": "and that's why in the standard algorithm",
            "5:00": "we put a zero here",
            "5:01": "before saying all right what's five times one?",

        "transcript": "- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this video is multiply the numbers 352 and 481. And we're gonna do it in two different ways, but realize that the underlying ideas are the same. So first let's just appreciate that 352 can be rewritten as 300 plus 50 plus two or we could think of it as two plus 50 plus 300, plus 300. You add these three numbers together, you're going to have 352. And same idea, 481 that's four hundreds, four hundreds, plus eight tens, which is 80, so plus 80, and then we have one one, so plus one. And you might have be familiar with multiplying like this in the past, setting up this grid. And it's essentially we're applying the distributive property. We're gonna take the two and multiply it times 400 plus 80 plus one. So we're gonna multiply two times each of those numbers, and actually I'm gonna just draw some quick lines here. So we have that, and then we'll have let me do it like this, then we have this, and then let me set up my grid. I'm having trouble drawing straight lines, okay there we go. Then one more in this direction. There you go. And then in this direction, let me draw some horizontal lines to have a neat clean grid here. There we go. Now first we'll multiply two times 400 plus 80 plus one. So two times 400 is 800. Two times, let me do it in that same blue color, so this is 800. Two times 80 is 160, and then two times one is two. And then we can multiply 50 times these. So what's 50 times 400? Well five times four is 20, and then we have another one, two, three zeros. So one, two, three, so that's 20,000. 50 times 80, five times eight is 40, and then we have two zeros, just like that. And then we have 50 times one which is of course going to be equal to 50. And then we go to the 300, which we will distribute and multiply times each of these, each of these numbers. 300 times 400, three times four is 12, and then we have four zeros. One, two, three, four. We get 120,000. 300 times 80, three times eight is 24, and then we have one, two, three zeros. One, two, three, so we get 24,000. And then 300 times one is of course equal to 300. And then what we wanna do is add up all of these numbers. So let's actually add up the rows first. So if we add up the rows, let me draw another line going straight down like that. And so if we sum this up, this is going to be 962. 800 plus 160 is 960 plus two, so this is 962. This right over here is 24,050. 24,050. And then this right over here is what 100 and, 144,300? 144,300. 120,000 plus 24,000 is 144,000 plus 300, there you have it. And then you would add up these numbers just like that to get your final answer. Now I'm gonna hold off doing that for a second as we see the other way of multiplying these numbers. So the other way of doing it, we could've said, 481, and this is sometimes called the standard algorithm, 481 times 300 and 50, let me do the same colors, 352. And in the standard algorithm, the way that we do it is we start with this two in the ones place and then we multiply it times 481. So two times one is two, two times eight is 16. So we put the six here and then we sometimes we will say we carry the one, but really regrouping that as hundreds. That's 10 tens which is hundreds. And then two times four is eight, which is really 800, plus one, so that's nine or really 900. You see a pattern here. This 962 is the exact same thing as that 962 right over there. Why? Well because we multiplied the 200 times the one, times the 80, times the 400. We saw that over here, and then we just added 'em all together to be 962. That's all the standard algorithm did just now. And then we move over to the five. But this is really five tens or 50, and that's why in the standard algorithm we put a zero here before saying all right what's five times one? It's five. What's five times eight? It is 40. We regroup the four. Let's delete this from before. What's five times four? Well that's 20 plus four is 24. Notice 24,050, that's exactly what we had over here, and it makes sense because we're taking a 50 and we're multiplying it times 481 which is exactly what we did right over there. And so you might guess what's gonna happen when we take this three and we multiply it times 481. That's really a 300 times 481. Let me delete that so I don't get confused. So because it's a 300, in the standard algorithm, we put two zeros here first. And when I say algorithm it just means a method of doing something. And so we'll say three times one is three. Three times eight is 24. And then three times four is 12 plus two is 14. And so notice, I have 144,300. And the standard way of doing it at this point we just add 'em all up. So whether we're doing it here or here, we just add everything up. So two plus zero plus zero is two. Six plus five is 11. Regroup that one. So one plus nine plus three is 13. And then one plus four plus four is nine. Two plus four is six. Then we have a one right over there, so we get 169,312. And so when you just learn this method, the standard algorithm we some people might call it, it might seem like hey this just seems like a little bit of magic. But all you're doing is you're going to each of these places and you're distributing it, you're multiplying it times 400 plus 80 plus one to get this. Then you're multiplying 50 times 400 plus 80 plus one, and then 300 times 400 plus 80 plus one, exactly what we did right over here.",

And I write the smaller number right below it. And since the smaller number is only one digit, it's only a ones digit, I put that below the ones place on the larger number. So I'll put the 3 right over here. And of course, we can't forget our multiplication symbol. And this is essentially a way of saying the same thing. You could read this as 32 times 3. But 32 times 3 is the exact same value as 3 times 32. It doesn't matter what order you multiply in. Now let's try to compute it. And once again, this is only one way of doing it. There's many ways of doing it. And I want you to think about why this works. We'll start with this 3 down here, and we're going to multiply it times each of the digits in 32. So we'll start with 3 times 2. Well, 3 times 2 from our multiplication tables, and you can figure it out even if you didn't know your multiplication tables, is 6. So 3 times 2, I'll write 6 right over here in the ones place. Now we're going to figure out what 3 times 3 is. Well, once again, we know that 3 times 3 is 9. And since I'm multiplying times the tens place right over here, I'm going to put it in the tens place right like this. So we're done. We got 32 times 3 is 96. And I really encourage you to think about why this worked. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint here. I'll give you a little bit of a hint about why this worked. Remember, 3 times 32 is the same thing as 3 times 30 plus 3 times 2. And if you look at it that way, that's essentially what this process did. We did 3 times 2 is 6. 3 times 30 is 90.

I'm going to write the 9 right below it and write our little multiplication symbol. And now, we're ready to compute. So first we can tackle 9 times 5. Well, we know that 9 times 5 is 45. We can write the 5 in the ones place and carry the 5 to the tens place. So 9 times 5 is 45. Now we're ready to move on to 9 times 8. And we're going to calculate 9 times 8 and then add the 4 that we just carried. So 9 times 8 is 72, plus the 4 is 76. So we'll write the 6 right here the tens place and carry the 7. Now we are ready to calculate, and I'm looking for a suitable color. 9 times 0 100's plus-- and this is a 7 in the hundreds place, so that's actually 700. Or if we're just kind of going with the computation, 9 times 0 plus 7. Well, 9 times 0 is 0, plus 7 is 7. And then, finally, we have-- and once again, I'm looking for a suitable color-- 9 times 8. This is the last thing we have to compute. We already know that 9 times 8 is 72. And we just write the 72 right down here, and we're done. 8,085 times 9 is 72,765. Let's do one more example just to make sure that this is really clear in your brain, at least the process for doing this. And I also want you to think about why this works. So let's try 7 times 5,396. And I encourage you to pause it and try it on your own as well. I'm going to rewrite it-- 5,396 times 7. First, we'll think about what 7 times 6 is. We know that's 42.

So we put the 7 down here and carry the 6. Then we have to worry about 7 times 3 plus this 6 that we had just finished carrying. 7 times 3 is 21, plus 6 is 27. So we'll write the 7 here in the hundreds place and carry the 2. And then, finally, we have 7 times 5, which is 35. But we have to add the 2. 35 plus 2 is 37. So 5,396 times 7 is 37,772.",

And the way that we're going to tackle it is we're going to first multiply 36 times 7, figure out what that is. Then we're going to multiply 36 times 20, figure out what that is, and then add those two numbers together. And what I want to do is first do this, just show you the process for how to multiply these two numbers. And then I'm going to do it again where we're going to think a little bit more about what the different numbers represent. So first let's start with the process. So I'm going to multiply 36 times 7 or 7 times 36. So I can start in the ones place. 7 times 6 is 42. Write the 2 down here. And then the 4, which represents 40, I can put in the tens place. 7 times 3 is 21, plus 4 is 25. So I could write the 25 right over here. There's no place to carry this 2, so I just wrote the 2 right over here in the hundreds place. Now let's move over. So let me clean this up so we don't get confused. So we just figured out what 7 times 36 is. It is 252. Now let's worry about what 36 times 20 is. And so what we're going to do is we're going to throw a 0 right over here, because we're now going to multiply 36 times something in the tens place. This isn't just a 2. This is a 20. So let's just go with the digits right now and then we'll think about it in terms of place value the second time around. 2 times 6 is 12. Write the 2 right over here. Carry the 1. 2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. So we just figured out that 36 times 20 is 720. And just think about what would've happened if we didn't put the 0 here. Then we would have figured out that 36 times 2 is 72, but this 2 isn't just a 2. This is a 20. So 36 times 20 is 720. And now we can add these two things because 36 times 27 is the same thing as 36 times 20 plus 36 times 7. So let's add these two numbers together. 2 plus 0 is 2. 5 plus 2 is 7. 2 plus 7 is 9. And we get 972. Now I'm going to do this exact same problem again. But this time, I'm going to really talk about what these digits represent. Hopefully the first pass, you kind of saw the process for doing it. Now we're going to think about what these digits actually represent. So we're going to multiply 36 times 7. So 7 times 6 is 42. We would write the 2 in the ones place, and then the 40 we can write in the tens place. This 4 represents 40. 7 times 30 is 210, plus 40 is 250. And we already had that 2 in the ones place, so we get 252. 36 times 7 is 252. Now let's clean this up. Now let's multiply-- 20 times 6 is going to give us 120. So let's write the 20 in the tens place, and then carry the 100, or carry the 1, which represents 100. Now, 2 times-- or I should say 20 times 30 is going to give you 600, plus one more 100 is going to give you 700. So we just figured out that 36 times 20 is 720. The 7 is in the hundreds place, 2 in the tens place. And then we can add again. And just like we did the last time, we got 972.",

        "transcript": "We now have the general tools to really tackle any multiplication problems. So in this video I'm just going to do a ton of examples. So let's start off with-- and I'll start in yellow. Let's start off with 32 times 18. Say 8 times 2 is 16. Well, I'll do it in our head this time because you always don't have all this space to work with. So 8 times 2 is 16. Put the 1 up there. 8 times 3 is 24. 24 plus 1 is 25. So 8 times 32 was 256. Now we're going to have to multiply this 1, which is really a 10, times 32. I'll underline it with the orange. 1 times 2-- oh, we have to be very careful here. 1 times 2 is 2. So you might say hey, let me stick a 2 down there. Remember, this isn't a 1. This is a 10, so we have to stick a 0 there to remember that. So 10 times 2 is 20. Or you say 1 times 2 is 2, but you're putting it in the 2's place, so you still get 20. So 10 times 2 is 20. It works out. Then 1 times 3. And we have to be very careful. Let's get rid of what we had from before. 1 times 3 is 3. There's nothing to add here, so you just get a 3. And so you get 10 times 32 is 320. This 1 right here, that's a 10. 10 plus 8 is 18. So now we just add up the two numbers. You add them up. 6 plus 0 is 6. 5 plus 2 is 7. 2 plus 3 is 5. Let's keep going. Let's do 99 times 88. So a big number. 8 times 9 is 72. Stick the 7 up there. And then you have 8 times 9 again. 8 times 9 is 72, but now you have the 7 up here. So 72 plus 7 is 79. Fair enough. Now we're done with this. Let's just delete it just so that we don't get confused in our next step. In our next we're going to multiply this 8 now times 99. But this 8 is an 80. So let's stick a 0 down there. 8 times 9 is 72. Stick a 7 up there. Then 8 times 9 is 72. Plus 7 is 79. 2 plus 0 is 2. Let me switch colors. 9 plus 2 is 11. Carry the 1. 1 plus 7 is 8. 8 plus 9 is 17. Carry the 1. 1 plus 7 is 8. 8,712. Let's keep going. Can't do enough of these. All right, 53 times 78. I think you're getting the hang of it now. Let's multiply 8 times 53 first. So 8 times 3 is 24. Stick the 2 up there. 8 times 5 is 40. 40 plus 2 is 42. Now we're going to have to deal with that 7 right there, which is really a 70. So we got to remember to put the 0 there. 7 times 3, and let's get rid of this. Don't want to get confused. 7 times 3 is 21. Put the 1 there and put the 2 up here. 7 times 5 is 35. Plus 2 is 37. Now we're ready to add. 4 plus 0 is 4. 2 plus 1 is 3. 4 plus 7 is 11. Carry the 1. 1 plus 3 is 4. 4,134. Let's up the stakes a little bit. So let's say I had 796 times 58. Let's mix it up well. All right, so first we're just going to multiply 8 times 796. And notice, I've thrown in an extra digit up here. So 8 times 6 is 48. Put the 4 up there. 8 times 9 is 72. Plus 4 is 76. And then 8 times 7 is 56. 56 plus 7 is 63. I'm sure I'll make a careless mistake at some point in this video. And the goal for you is to identify if and when I do. All right, now we're ready, so we can get rid of these guys up here. Now we can multiply this 5, which is in the 10's place. It's really a 50. Times this up here. Because it's a 50 we stick a 0 down there. 5 times 6 is 30. Put the 0 there, put the 3 up there. 5 times 9 is 45. Plus the 3 is 48. 5 times 7 is 35. Plus 4 is 39. Now we're ready to add. 8 plus 0 is 8. 6 plus 0 is 6. 3 plus 8 is 11. 1 plus 6 is 7. 7 plus 9 is 16. And then 1 plus 3 is 4. So 796 times 58 is 46,168. And that sounds about right because 796-- it's almost 800. You know, which is almost 1,000. So if we multiplied 1,000 times 58 we'd get 58,000. But we're multiplying something a little bit smaller than 1,000 times 58, so we're getting something a little bit smaller than 58,000. So the number is in the correct ballpark. Now let's do one more here where I'm really going to step up the stakes. Let's do 523 times-- I'm going to do a three-digit number now. Times 798. That's a big three-digit number. But it's the same exact process. And once you kind of see the pattern you say, hey, this'll apply to any number of digits times any number of digits. It'll just start taking you a long time and your chances of making a careless mistake are going to go up, but it's the same idea. So we start with 8 times 523. 8 times 3 is 24. Stick the 2 up there. Now 8 times 2 is 16. 16 plus 2 is 18. Put the 1 up there. 8 times 5 is 40. Plus 1 is 41. So 8 times 523 is 4,184. We're not done. We have to multiply times the 90 and by the 700. So let's do the 90 right there. So it's a 90, so we'll stick a 0 there. It's not a 9. And let's get rid of these guys right there. 9 times 3 is 27. 9 times 2 is 18. 18 plus 2 is 20. And then we have 9 times 5 is 45. 45 plus 2 is 47. I don't want to write that thick. 47. Let me make sure I did that one right, and let's just review it a little bit. 9 times 3 was 27. We wrote the 7 down here and put the 2 up there. 9 times 2 is 18. We added 2 to that, so we wrote 20. Wrote the 0 down there and the 2 up there. The 9 times 5 was 45. Plus 2 is 47. You really have to make sure you don't make careless mistakes with these. Then finally, we have to multiply the 7, which is really a 700 times 523. When it was just an 8 we just started multiplying here. When it was a 90, when we were dealing with the 10's place, we put a 0 there. Now that we're dealing with something that's in the 100's, we're going to put two 0's there. And so you have 7-- and let's get rid of this stuff. That'll just mess us up. 7 times 3 is 21. Put the 1 there. Stick the 2 up there. 7 times 2 is 14. 14 plus our 2 is 16. Put the 1 up there. 7 times 5 is 35. Plus 1 is 36. And now we're ready to add. And hopefully we didn't make any careless mistakes. So 4 plus 0 plus 0. That's easy. That's 4. 8 plus 7 plus 0. That's 15. Carry the 1. 1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3. 4 plus 7 plus 6. That's what's? 4 plus 6 is 10. It's 17. And then we have 1 plus 4 is 5. 5 plus 6 is 11. Carry the 1. 1 plus 3 is 4. So 523 times 798 is 417,354. Now we can even check to make sure. And so this is the moment of truth. Let's see if we have-- let's see. 523 times 798. There you go. Moment of truth. I don't have to re-record this video. It's 417,354. But we did it without the calculator, which is the important point.",

So we have a running total of 4,090+79 = 4,169 hundreds so far.\n\nCross multiply the last two digits by the last two digits: (2x8)+(3x9) = 16+27 = 43. This represents 43 tens.

        "transcript": "Let's tackle a slightly more interesting division problem. So we're going to take 280 and divide it by 5. And I encourage you to pause this video and try to apply the technique that we've seen in a previous video to try to figure out what 280 divided by 5 is. So let's have our go at it. So we could rewrite this. We've already seen this as 280 divided by 5. So the first question we can ask ourselves is, how many times does 5 go into 2? Well, 5 doesn't go into 2 at all. It goes 0 times. 0 times 5 is 0. And then we subtract. 2 minus 0 is 2. And now, we can bring down the next digit, which, in this case, is an 8. And so we can ask ourselves, how many times does 5 go into 28 without going over it? So we could think, well, let's see 5 times 5 is 25. 5 times 6 is 30. So 5 times 6 would go over 28. So we want to go back to 5 times 5. So 5 goes into 28 5 times. 5 times 5 is 25. And you subtract. 28 minus 25 is 3. And now, let's bring down the next digit. In this case, the digit is a 0. So how many times does 5 go into 30? Well, it goes exactly 6 times. We've already talked about that. 6 times 5 is 30. We subtract. And we have nothing left over. So we just figured out that 280 divided by 5 is equal to 56. Now, why did this work? Well, the first way to think about it, this was actually 200. And we were thinking about, do we put anything in the hundreds place here? So one way of thinking about it, how many hundreds of times does 5 go into 200? And it doesn't go any multiples of 100. And if that's a little confusing, don't worry too much about it. But I want you to really think deeply about the place notation. But then we were able to, again, extend it to instead of just 200 but then 280. This 28 right over here, if you think about it, this 2 is in the hundreds place. This 8 is in the tens place. So this is really representing 280. And we said, how many tens of times does 5 go into 280? Well, it goes 5 tens times, or it goes 50 times. 50 times 5 is 250. When you subtract 250 from 280, you've got 30. And there were no other things in the ones place here. So we just have to figure out how many times does 5 go into 30. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of what's actually happening behind this little process. It's not just magic. We're really just keeping track of place value here. The other thing I want to show you is that we didn't necessarily have to write this 0 here. Another way of computing it, we could have said 280 divided by 5. And we could've said, how many times does 5 go into 2? Well, it doesn't go any times. So let's just think about 5 going into 28. Well, 5 goes into 28 5 times. 5 times 5 is 25. Subtract. 28 minus 25 is 3. Bring down the 0. 5 goes into 30 six times. 6 times 5 is 30. And we have nothing left over. And again, what we're really saying is that 5 doesn't go into 200 any hundreds of times. If this was a 500, you could say, hey, it's going to go in it 100 times. But instead, we go, well, what about 5 going into 280? Well, it goes 50 times. 50 times 5 is 250. 280 minus 250 is 30. 5 goes into 30 six times. So hopefully, that makes a little bit of sense.",

But my brain tries to approximate these numbers so that my times tables knowledge does come in handy. For example, 31 is close to 30. And this is why I'm saying it's a bit of an art, but I'm saying, hey, look, this is pretty close to 30.

Instead of three times four is 12, 30 times four is 120, 150 instead of 15, 180 instead of 18 for 30 times six, and gee, this looks pretty close to 180. So this looks close to 30 times six. And if this is close to 30, well, maybe, maybe this is, maybe this is going to be six right over here. And I'm gonna put a question mark because then the natural thing to do is to actually try it out. Figure out what is six times 31? I'll put the question mark here again. Is this equal to six? Well, the art part is you've made a good, or we've made a good guess here. Now let's try to verify that maybe it is six, maybe it isn't. So let's multiply six, or let's multiple 31 times six. 31 times six, one times six is six, and then three times six, which is really 30 times six, is gonna be 180 right over here. So this is 186. So it all works out. 186 divided by 31 is indeed six. We can get rid of this question mark here. Let's do another example. So let me delete. Let me delete that as well. Let's say we want to figure out what 336 divided by 48 is equal to. So pause this video, and see if you can figure it out. So the way I would think about it, this thing right over here is close to 50, close to 50. And this thing, well, if you think about the multiples of 50, you have things like 300, which would be 50 times six. And then you have 350, which would be 50 times seven, because five times seven is 35. And so let's think about this, and actually let me write these things down. If I were to say 50 times six, that's the same thing as, well, that's gonna be five times six times 10, which is 300. If I say 50 times seven, that's going to be 350. Five times seven is 35, and then you're multiplying that by 10. But this number is someplace in between 300 and 350. So my candidates for what this is going to be, well, I'm saying, hey, maybe this is six, maybe this is seven. And what I would do is I would try out each of them. So let's try out 48 times six. So let's try that, this first candidate out. 48 times six, so eight times six is going to be 48. Four times six is 24, plus four is 288. So that actually seems a good bit lower than this. It actually seems almost exactly 48 lower. So I could probably, I'm feeling pretty confident that I can squeeze another 48 into this. So instead of squeezing, instead of being able to divide 6/48 into this, I'm feeling pretty good that maybe seven is the answer, but let me try it out. So this, so six is not going to be my answer, I tried it out. Let me try 48 times seven. 48 times seven, eight times seven is 56, four times seven is 28, plus three, 336. That's exactly right. So there you have it, with a little bit of trial and error, but it was an informed trial and error, we got 336 divided by 48 is equal to seven. This is what I meant, that it's a bit of an art.",

            "6:34": "So this number actually is divisible by 3.",
            "6:35": "So let me change it a little bit, so it's",

            "6:50": "Just so you see what it looks like.",
            "6:53": "So let's do this one.",

        },
        "transcript": "It never hurts to get a lot of practice, so in this video I'm just going to do a bunch more of essentially, what we call long division problems. And so if you have 4 goes into 2,292. And I don't know exactly why they call it long division, and we saw this in the last video a little bit. I didn't call it long division then, but I think the reason why is it takes you a long time or it takes a long piece of your paper. As you go along, you kind of have this thing, this long tail that develops on the problem. So all of those are, at least, reasons in my head why it's called long division. But we saw in the last video there's a way to tackle any division problem while just knowing your multiplication tables up to maybe 10 times 10 or 12 times 12. But just as a bit of review, this is the same thing as 2,292 divided by 4. And it's actually the same thing, and you probably haven't seen this notation before, as 2,292 divided by 4. This, this, and this are all equivalent statements on some level. And you could say, hey Sal, that looks like a fraction in case you have seen fractions already. And that is exactly what it is. It is a fraction. But anyway, I'll just focus on this format and in future videos we'll think about other ways to represent division. So let's do this problem. So 4 goes into 2 how many times? It goes into 2 no times, so let's move on to-- let me just switch colors. So let's move on to the 22. 4 goes into 22 how many times? Let's see. 4 times 5 is equal to 20. 4 times 6 is equal to 24. So 6 is too much. So 4 goes into 22 five times. 5 times 4 is 20. There's going to be a little bit of a leftover. And then we subtract 22 minus 20. Well that's just 2. And then you bring down this 9. And you saw in the last video exactly what this means. When you wrote this 5 up here-- notice we wrote in the 100's place. So this is really a 500. But in this video I'm just going to focus more on the process, and you can think more about what it actually means in terms of where I'm writing the numbers. But I think the process is going to be crystal clear hopefully, by the end of this video. So we brought down the 9. 4 goes into 29 how many times? It goes into at least six times. What's 4 times 7? 4 times 7 is 28. So it goes into it at least seven times. What's 4 times 8? 4 times 8 is 32, so it can't go into it eight times so it's going to go into it seven. 4 goes into 29 nine seven times. 7 times 4 is 28. 29 minus 28 to get our remainder for this step in the problem is 1. And now we're going to bring down this 2. We're going to bring it down and you get a 12. 4 goes into 12? That's easy. 4 times 3 is 12. 4 goes into 12 three times. 3 times 4 is 12. 12 minus 12 is 0. We have no remainder. So 4 goes into 2,292 exactly 573 times. So this 2,292 divided by 4 we can say is equal to 573. Or we could say that this thing right here is equal to 573. Let's do a couple of more. Let's do a few more problems. So I'll do that red color. Let's say we had 7 going into 6,475. Maybe it's called long division because you write it nice and long up here and you have this line. I don't know. There's multiple reasons why it could be called long division. So you say 7 goes into 6 zero times. So we need to keep moving forward. So then we go to 64. 7 goes into 64 how many times? Let's see. 7 times 7 is? Well, that's way too small. Let me think about it a little bit. Well 7 times 9 is 63. That's pretty close. And then 6 times 10 is going to be too big. 7 times 10 is 70. So that's too big. So 7 goes into 64 nine times. 9 times 7 is 63. 64 minus 63 to get our remainder of this stage 1. Bring down the 7. 7 goes into 17 how many times? Well, 7 times 2 is 14. And then 7 times 3 is 21. So 3 is too big. So 7 goes into 17 two times. 2 times 7 is 14. 17 minus 14 is 3. And now we bring down the 5. And 7 goes into 35? That's in our 7 multiplication tables, five times. 5 times 7 is 35. And there you go. So the remainder is zero. So all the examples I did so far had no remainders. Let's do one that maybe might have a remainder. And to ensure it has a remainder I'll just make up the problem. It's much easier to make problems that have remainders than the ones that don't have remainders. So let's say I want to divide 3 into-- I'm going to divide it into, let's say 1,735,092. This will be a nice, beastly problem. So if we can do this we can handle everything. So it's 1,735,092. That's what we're dividing 3 into. And actually, I'm not sure if this will have a remainder. In the future video I'll show you how to figure out whether something is divisible by 3. Actually, we can do it right now. We can just add up all these digits. 1 plus 7 is 8. 8 plus 3 is 11. 11 5 five is 16. 16 plus 9 is 25. 25 plus 2 is 27. So actually, this number is divisible by 3. So if you add up all of the digits, you get 27. And then you can add up those digits-- 2 plus 7 is 9. So that is divisible by 9. That's a trick that only works for 3. So this number actually is divisible by 3. So let me change it a little bit, so it's not divisible by 3. Let me make this into a 1. Now this number will not be divisible by 3. I definitely want a number where I'll end up with a remainder. Just so you see what it looks like. So let's do this one. 3 goes into 1 zero times. So we can just move forward. You could write a 0 here and multiply that out, but that just makes it a little bit messy in my head. So we just move one to the right. 3 goes into 17 how many times? Well, 3 times 5 is equal to 15. And 3 times 6 is equal to 18 and that's too big. So 3 goes into 17 right here five times. 5 times 3 is 15. And we subtract. 17 minus 15 is 2. And now we bring down this 3. 3 goes into 23 how many times? Well, 3 times 7 is equal to 21. And 3 times 8 is too big. That's equal to 24. So 3 goes into 23 seven times. 7 times 3 is 21. Then we subtract. 23 minus 21 is 2. Now we bring down the next number. We bring down the 5. I think you can appreciate why it's called long division now. We bring down this 5. 3 goes into 25 how many times? Well, 3 times 8 gets you pretty close and 3 times 9 is too big. So it goes into it eight times. 8 times 3 is 24. I'm going to run out of space. You subtract, you get 1. 25 minus 24 is 1. Now we can bring down this 0. And you get 3 goes into 10 how many times? That's easy. It goes into it three times. 3 times 3 is 9. That's about as close to 10 as we can get. 3 times 3 is 9. 10 minus 9, I'm going to have to scroll up and down here a little bit. 10 minus 9 is 1, and then we can bring down the next number. I'm running out of colors. I can bring down that 9. 3 goes into 19 how many times? Well, 6 is about as close as we can get. That gets us to 18. 3 goes into 19 six times. 6 times 3-- let me scroll down. 6 times 3 is 18. 19 minus 18-- we subtract it up here too. 19 minus 18 is 1 and then we're almost done. I can revert back to the pink. We bring down this 1 right there. 3 goes into 11 how many times? Well, that's three times because 3 times 4 is too big. 3 times 4 is 12, so that's too big. So it goes into it three times. So 3 goes into 11 three times. 3 times 3 is 9. And then we subtract and we get a 2. And there's nothing left to bring down. When we look up here there's nothing left to bring down, so we're done. So we're left with the remainder of 2 after doing this entire problem. So the answer, 3 goes into 1,735,091-- it goes into it 578,363 remainder 2. And that remainder 2 was what we got all the way down there. So hopefully you now appreciate and you can tackle pretty much any division problem. And you also, through this exercise, can appreciate why it's called long division.",

To make you understand more clearly, remainders are more like a leftover, because the number can\u2019t fit in more. But decimals and fractions [etc.] are parts of a whole. Decimals and fractions [etc.] are used to show where exactly a number is. So, there is a difference between 4, and 4.6 tenths. Thus, remainders are leftovers and Decimals and fractions [etc.] are parts of a whole. So the quick answer to your question is no, remainders are not decimals or fractions. Thank you!

        "transcript": "Let's divide 9,815 by 65, or figure out how many times the 65 go into 9,815. And I encourage you to pause this video and try this on your own. So let me just rewrite this as 9,815 divided by 65. And we write it this way because it's easier to manipulate the numbers, kind of doing the standard process here. And as we'll see, whenever we divide by a number that has more than one digit, there's a little bit of an art to it. And hopefully you'll get an appreciation for that art over the course of this video. So first we could think about well, how many times does 65 go into 9? Well it doesn't go into 9 at all so we can move one digit to the right. How many times does it go into 98 without going over it? Well 65 times 1 is 65 so that doesn't go over it. And 65 times 2, well that would be 130 so that would go over 98. So it only goes one time. We multiply 1 times 65, which is 65. And then we could subtract to see how much we have left over. So 8 minus 5 is 3 and 9 minus 6 is 3. And now we can bring down the next digit, this 1 here. And now this is where the art is going to come into play because we need to figure out how many times does 65 go into 331 without going over it. And you might just try to look at these numbers, try to approximate them a little bit. You might say, well, maybe 65, let me round this thing up. Maybe this is close to 70. And let's see, this is close to 300. So maybe we say, well, 70 would go into 300. So maybe we think about how many times does 70 go into 300? And we say without going over it, it doesn't go exactly into 300. Well you could say, well how many times does 7 go into 30? Well we know 7 goes into 30 four times. 4 times 7 is 28. So maybe try a 4 right over here because then this will be 280, 4 times 70 is 280. You're still going to have a little bit left over, but what you have left over is going to be less than 70. It's going to be 20. So you say, well, if this is roughly 70 and if this is roughly 300, then maybe it's going to be the same thing. So let's try that out. Let's see if it goes four times. So 4 times 5 is 20, carry the 2. 4 times 6 is 24 plus 2 is 26. And now let's see how much we had left over. So when we subtract, we are left with-- I'll do this in a new color-- 1 minus 0 is 1. We have a 3 here and a 6 here so we're going to have to do a little regrouping. Let's take 100 from the hundreds place. It becomes 200. Give those 10 tens, that 100, to the tens place. So now we have 13 tens. 13 minus 6 is 7 and then 2 minus 2 is 1. So did this work out? Well no, our remainder, after we said it went in four times, we actually had 71 left over. 71, this right over here, is larger than 65. You don't want a situation where what you have left over is larger than what you're trying to divide into the number. You could have gone into it one more time because you had so much left over. So this 4 was actually too low. We should have probably approximated this as 60, and 60 goes into 300, if we were to estimate, we'd say, well that might be closer to five times. So this is where the art of this comes into play. So it was very reasonable to do what I just did, but it just turned out to not be the right way to think about it. I could just say, well the 4 wasn't enough. I had too much left over. Let me try 5 now. 5 times 5 is 25, carry the 2. 5 times 6 is 30, plus 2 is 32. There you go. We got much closer to 331 without going over. Now we can subtract. And once again, we could do a little regrouping. Take a 10 from the tens place. This becomes two tens. This becomes an 11. 11 minus 5 is 6, 2 minus 2 is 0, 3 minus 3 is 0. So we only have 6 left over, which is obviously less than 65. So we're all good. And if we put a 6 here, we would have gone over 331. And so that wouldn't have been cool either. But anyway, let's bring down the next digit. Let's bring down the 5. So how many times does 65 go into 65? Well, it goes one time. 1 times 65,-- OK. Ignore this, that's from a previous step-- 1 times 65 is 65. And then you subtract, and we have no remainder. So we see that 65 goes into 9,815 exactly 150-- let me just that in that same blue color, I don't want to do all these arbitrary colors-- 151 times.",

        "transcript": "What we're going to talk about in this video is the idea of a fraction. And we'll see there's many ways to think about a fraction. But first, we'll think about the most fundamental. So let's say that I have this square. And we can consider this a whole. So let me write that down. This is a whole. It is a complete square. Now, what I'm going to do is divide this into 4 equal parts. So with one cut like that, I've divided it into 2 equal parts, and then with another cut like this, I could divide it into 4 equal parts. So there are 4 equal parts. And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to select one of those equal parts, so let's say this part right over here. I am going to select that. So the question is, what fraction of the whole is the part that I have shaded in red? Well, it is 1 out of the 4 equal parts, right? I've shaded in 1 out of 1, 2, 3, 4 equal parts. So we write this as this fraction. This piece represents 1/4 of the whole. And there's two ways that you can think about this. You could view this as 1 of the 4 equal parts, or you could view this as a whole divided by 4 would get you exactly this much. Now let's do another one. And this time, let's think about how we could represent 1 over 8, so 1 over 8. Well, we could divide this whole, in this case, the whole is this rectangle-looking thing. We could divide the whole into 8 equal parts. So let's do that. So here I've divided into 2 equal parts. That looks pretty good. And now I can divide each of those into 2 equal parts to get me 4 equal parts. And then if I were to divide each of those into 2 equal parts, I will have 8 equal parts. And it's not exact. Obviously, I've drawn it by hand, but hopefully this gets you a sense. So now I have 8 equal parts. And now I'm going to select exactly one of them. And that'll represent 1/8. And I could select any one of these, but I'll just do this one to show you it does not have to be necessarily the first one. So once again, this square right over here that I'm shading in red represents 1/8 of the whole. Now, let's look at a few more examples where I've shaded them in ahead of time. And what I want you to do right now is pause the video, and either in your head or a piece of paper write down if you consider this purple thing, the whole, what fraction does this red part represent? If you consider this blue part the whole, what fraction does this red part represent? If you view this yellow triangle as a whole, what fraction does this red part represent? And so I encourage you to pause the video now. Well, let's look at each of these. So in this case, for this rectangle, we have 3 equal parts, and we've shaded in one of them. So this red rectangle right over here represents 1/3 of the whole. Now, Over here, in this kind of pie-looking thing, this circle-looking thing, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 equal parts. And we have shaded in 1 of those 5 equal parts. So this little slice of the pie, this represents 1/5. This right over here is 1/5 of the entire pie. Now, this one's interesting. You might be tempted to say, well, I've got 5 parts, and then I've shaded in 1. That must represent 1/4. But remember, it needs to be 4 equal parts. And it's pretty clear looking at this that this part right over here is not equal in size to this part right over here or this part right over here. These are not 4 equal parts. So we cannot say that this is 1/4 of the triangle. So you cannot say that.",

                "a": "Hey,\n\nWhat a great question! Let's go think about it using geometry. I'm gonna assume that that triangle is equilateral. Equilateral means the triangle has all the sides of the same length and all the angles of the same size. Looking at the video we can see that one of the sides is devided into four 1/4ths. Therefore we might think that the area of each part is 1/4th of the whole triangle as well, but unfortunately we're looking for equal area not equal parts of a side.\n\nLet's leave calculations aside - when we look at the small triangle and the whole triangle, we have to ask ourselves: \"How many times would that small triangle fit into the whole?\" Try imagining having infinite amount of these small triangle to play with and your goal is to build a copy of the whole triangle. How many triangles would you need? The answer is excatly 8 - meaning that the small triangle is just a 1/8th.\n\nCALCULATIONS\n\nSo what is the area of that small triangle compared to the whole shape? Let's do some calculations: Let's say each side of the whole triangle is excatly 1 cm (you can also use inches or no units as well if that helps). So how big is the whole triangle? The formula for area of any triangle is half of base times it's heigth also known as bh/2. Don't worry if you don't understand right now. We can find the height using the pythagorean theorem, which tells us that the heigth will be approximetly 0,87 cm or to be exact the half of the square root of 3.\n\nSo we know the whole triangle is approximetly 0,435 cm squared large. So how big is the smaller triangle? Using the same ways of calculations we get that the area of the small triangle is approximetly 0,05 cm squared.\n\nTo summarize:\nWHOLE triangle \u2248 0,435 cm squared.\nSmaller triangle \u2248 0,05 cm squared.\n\nSmaller triangle \u00f7 Whole triangle \u2248\n0,05 \u00f7 0,435 \u2248\n50 \u00f7 435 \u2248 0,115 \u2248 1/8 th"

        "transcript": "I have a square here divided into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine equal sections. And we've already seen that if we were to shade in one of these sections, if we were to select one of these sections, let's say the middle one right over here, this is one out of the nine equal sections. So if someone said, what fraction of the whole does this purple square represent? Well, you would say, well, that represents 1/9 of the whole. This thing right over here represents 1/9. Now what would happen if we shaded in more than that? So let's say we shaded in this one and this one, let me shade it in a little bit better. And this one and this one right over here. Now what fraction of the whole have we shaded in? Well, each of these, we've already seen, each of these represent 1/9. So that's 1/9, that's 1/9. When I say 1/9, I could also say a ninth. So this is 1/9 or a ninth, so each of these represents a ninth. But how many of these ninths do we have shaded in? Well we have one, two, three, four shaded in. So now we have a total of 4/9 shaded it. 4 of the 9 equal sections are shaded in. So 4/9 of the whole is shaded in. Now let's make things a little bit more interesting. Let's shade in. So here I have five equal sections. Let me write this down. I have five equal sections. And let me shade in five of them. So one, two, three, four, five. We already know that each of these sections, each of these situated in sections represent 1/5. So 1/5, another way of saying that is a fifth, is 1/5. But now how much do I have shaded in? Well I have five out of the five equal sections shaded, or I have 5/5 shaded in. And you might be saying, wait, wait, if I gave five out of the five equal sections shaded in, if I have 5/5 shaded in, I've got the whole thing shaded in. And you would be absolutely right. 5/5 is equal to the whole. Now what I want you to do is pause this video and write down on a piece of paper or at least think in your head, what fraction of each of these wholes is shaded in? So let's go to this first one. We have one, two, three, four, five, six equal sections. And we see that one, two, three, four are shaded in. So 4/6 of this figure is shaded in. Let's go over here. We have one, two, three, four, five equal sections. And one, two, three, four are shaded in. So here, 4/5 of this circle is shaded in. Now in this figure, I have two equal sections and both of them are shaded in. And this we would say two halves of this figure are shaded in. And once again, if two halves are shaded in, that means everything is shaded in, that this represents a whole. Now this one right over here it might be tempting to say, I have one, two, three, four sections and one, two, three have been shaded in so maybe the red represents 3/4 of the figure. But remember, the sections have to be equal sections. And this red section is way bigger. It actually looks like it's bigger than the other three combined. So you do not have four equal sections here. So at least based on how it's drawn, you can't say that 3/4 is actually filled in.",

        "transcript": "So I've got a whole pizza here, and let's say that I were to cut it into two equal pieces. Let me cut it right over here into 2 equal pieces. And let's say that I ate one of those 2 equal pieces. So let's say I ate all of this right over here. What fraction of the pizza have I eaten? Well, I took the whole and I divide it into two equal pieces, and then I ate one of those pieces. So I ate 1/2 of the pizza. Now, let's imagine that instead of cutting that pizza into only 2 equal pieces, let's imagine instead that decide to cut it into 4 equal pieces. So let's draw that. So 4 equal pieces. So I could cut once this way and then I could cut it once this way. And so here I have 4 equal pieces. But let's say that I want to eat the same amount of pizza. How many of these 4 equal pieces would I have to eat. I encourage you to pause the video and think about that. Well, I would eat this piece. You could imagine me eating this piece and this piece right over here. I've eaten the same amount of the pizza. Each of these pieces you could imagine got cut into 2 pieces when I cut the whole pizza this way. And so now I have to eat 2 slices of the 4, as opposed to 1 slice of the 2. So I just ate 2 out of the 4 slices. I'm using different numbers here. Here I'm using a 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator. Here, I'm using a 2 in the numerator and a 4 in the denominator. These two fractions represent the same quantity. I ate the same amount of pizza. If I eat 2/4 of a pizza, if I eat 2 out of 4 equal pieces, that's the same fraction of the pizza as if I eat 1 out of 2 equal pieces. So we would say that these two things are equivalent fractions. Now let's do another one like this. Instead of just dividing it into 4 equal pieces, let's divide it into 8 equal pieces. So now we could cut once like this. So now we have 2 equal pieces. Cut once like this. Now we have 4 equal pieces. And then divide each of those 4 pieces into 2 pieces. So I'll cut those in-- So let's see. I want to make them equal pieces. Those don't look as equal as I would like. So that looks more equal, and that looks reasonably equal. So now how many equal pieces do I have? I have 8 equal pieces. But let's say I wanted to eat the same fraction of the pizza. So I could eat all of these pieces right over here. Well, how many of those 8 equal pieces have I eaten? Well, I've eaten 1, 2, 3, 4 of those 8 equal pieces. And so once again, this fraction, 4 of 8, or 4/8, is equivalent to 2/4, which is equivalent to 1/2. And you might see a little bit of a pattern here. Going from this scenario to this scenario, I got twice as many equal slices. Because I had twice as many equal slices, I needed to eat two times the number of slices. So I multiply the denominator by 2, and I multiply the numerator by 2. If I multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, then I'm not changing what that fraction represents. And you see that over here. Going from 4 slices to 8 slices, I cut every slice, I turned every slice into 2 more slices, so I had twice as many slices. And then if I want to eat the same amount, I have to eat twice as many pieces. So all of these, 1/2, 2/4, four 4/8, and I could keep going. I could do 8/16. I could do 16/32.

        "transcript": "Let's think about what fraction of this grid is actually shaded in pink. So the first thing we want to think about is how many equal sections do we have here? Well, this is a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 by 1, 2, 3 grid. So there's 15 sections here. You could also count it-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. So there are 15 equal sections here. And how many of those equal sections are actually shaded in this kind of pinkish color? Well, We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So it's 6/15 is shaded in. But I want to simplify this more. I have a feeling that there's some equivalent fractions that represent the exact same thing as 6/15. And to get a sense of that, let me redraw this a little bit, where I still shade in six of these rectangles, but I'll shade them a little bit in one chunk. So let me throw in another grid right over here, and let me attempt to shade in the rectangles as fast as possible. So that is 1-- 1 rectangle. I'll even make my thing even bigger. All right, 1 rectangle, 2 rectangles, 3 rectangles-- halfway there-- 4 rectangles, 5 rectangles shaded in and now 6 rectangles shaded in. So this right over here, what I just did, this is still 6 rectangles of the 15 rectangles are shaded in. So this is still 6/15. These are representing the same thing. But how can I simplify this even more? Well, when you look at it numerically, you see that both 6 and 15 are divisible by 3. In fact, their greatest common factor is 3. So what happens if we divide the numerator and denominator by 3? If we do the same thing to the numerator and the denominator, we're not going to be changing the value of the fraction. So let's divide the numerator by 3 and divide the denominator by 3. And what do we get? We get 2 over 5. Now how does this make sense in the context of this diagram right here? Well, we started off with 6 shaded in. You divide by 3, you have 2 shaded in. So you're essentially saying, hey, let's group these into sections of 3. So let's say that this right over here is one section of 3. This is one section of 3 right over here. So that's one section of 3. And then this is another section of 3 right over here. And so you have two sections of 3. And actually let me color it in a little bit better. So you have two sections of 3. And if you were to combine them, it looks just like this. Notice this is covering the exact same area as your 6 smaller ones did. And then how many equal sections of this size do you have on this entire thing? Well, you have 5 equal sections. Because this is one section of 3 right over here, this is another section of 3. And then this is another section of 3. So notice, you're covering the exact same area of the original thing. You're covering 2 out of the 5 equal sections. So 2/5 and 6/15 are equivalent fractions. So if you want to say what fraction of this is covered in the simplest form, you would say 2/5.",

The denomination of a paper bill is, for example, a \"twenty\". The denomination of a coin is, for example, 25 cents. to describe a collection of money, we must use two numbers, not one. For example, I have 2 twenties. the two, is the count, or the \"numerator\". In the world of fractions, this means that if I have a bag with 1/4 (quarters), if I want to label the bag, I have to use 2 numbers, somewhere I need to write quarter, and somewhere I have to write how many quarters are in the bag. So we have all agreed (about 1,500 years ago) to label a bag with three quarters, 3/4. The count goes on the top (or on the left) and the denomination, the number of pieces the whole was cut into (the denominator) goes on the bottom (or the right)."

So this 5 represents five ones, or I guess you could say that's just going to be 5. This 3, this is in the tens place. This is the tens place, so we have three tens. So that's just going to be 30. And the 2 is in the hundreds place. So putting a 2 there means that we have two hundreds. So this number we can view as two hundred, thirty, five. Or you could view it as two hundred plus thirty plus five. Now what I want to do in this video is think about place values to the right of the ones place.

Well whatever number I write here that tells us how many tenths we're dealing with.

To the left of the decimal point is the ones place, but I have a zero there, so this is 0 ones. Now I have 7 tenths, so this is the tenths place.

So this number right over here is-- we can rewrite it as 0-- let me write it this way-- we could rewrite it as 0 ones plus 7 tenths-- plus 7 tenths--- not tens, tenths-- plus 6 hundredths-- plus 6 hundredths-- not hundreds, hundredths. Or we could write this as 0 plus 7/10-- let me write that a little bit neater-- plus 7/10 plus 6/100-- 6 over 100. So you could write this-- 7/10 plus 6/100 is exactly what this is. You could say this is 0 ones, 7 tenths, and 6 hundredths. Now another way we could write this-- well look, if we wanted to write it as a fraction, or talk about it as a fraction-- I could ignore the 0, that's not going to change the value of the sum but I could add the 7/10 to the 6/100. So how could I write 7/10 in terms of hundredths? Well 7 over 10 is the same thing as 70 over 100. 7/10 is the same thing as 70 over 100. One way to thing about it is, if I multiply the denominator by 10 well, I can multiply the numerator by 10 as well and not change the value of it. 7/10 is the same thing as 70/100. And then you could add 6/100 to that-- 6/100 to that. And what will that give you? Well that's going to give you 76/100-- 76/100. So this number up here-- a lot of people will call this-- they might say 'zero point seven six' or they might call this 'seventy-six hundredths'. This is the hundredths place, this is the tenths place. But each tenth is worth ten hundredths. And you see that-- you could either view this as 7 tenths. or you could view it as 70 hundredths. So this is 76 hundredths. And you could keep going to the right. If you go to the right one more space you would get to the thousandths place and then the ten thousandths place. So you keep dividing by 10 each place you go to the right. And you multiply by 10 each place you go to the left.",

A reciprocal is a reversed fraction, so the reciprocal for 1/3 is 3/1.\nNow you multiply 7/8 by 3/1.\nTo multiply a fraction, multiply numerator and demoninator, so 7/8 x 3/1 equals 21/8, which is an improper fraction. To make it proper, you must know how many times 8 fits into 21, which is 2, because 2 x 8 equals 16, but 3 x 8 equals 24, so it\u2019s bigger than 21. Now we do 21 minus 16 to figure out the rest of the fraction. So we know that 21 - 16 = 5, and the denominator of 21/8 stays the same, so we have the mixed number 2 5/8.\n\nSo 7/8 divided by 1/3 equals 2 5/8.\n\n*and also the video is about decimal place value and we are so off-topic right now \ud83d\ude05"

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] Let's say that I had the number zero point one seven. How could I say this number? I said it one way, I said zero point one seven, but what are other ways that I could say it, especially if I wanted to express it in terms of tenths or hundredths or other places? And like always, try to pause the video and try think about it on your own. Alright, so there's actually a couple of ways that we could say this number. One is just to say zero point one seven. Other ways are to say look, I have a one in the tenths place, so that's going to be one tenth, one tenth and one tenth and I have a seven in the hundredths place, so this is a seven right over here in the hundredths place, so I can say one tenth and seven hundredths. Hun- Hundredths. And there you go. That's one way to say this number. Now another to think about it is just say the whole thing in terms of hundredths. So a tenth is how many hundredths? Well a tenth is the same thing as 10 hundredths, so you could say, you could say instead of a tenth, you could say this is 10 hundredths, and the way I'm writing it right now, very few people would actually do it this way. 10 hundredths and and seven hundredths. And seven hundredths. Well not I could just add these hundredths, if I have 10 hundredths and I have another seven hundredths, that's going to be 17 hundredths. So I could just write this down as 17 hundredths. Hundredths. And to make that intuition of how we could just call this 17 hundredths instead of just calling it one tenth and seven hundredths, let's actually count by hundredths. So that is one hundredth, that is two hundredth, and actually, let me just go straight to nine hundredths. So I skipped a bunch right over here. And what would be the next, how would I say 10 hundredths? Well 10 hundredths, let me write it this way, 10 hundredths is the same thing as one tenth. So if we go from nine hundredths, the next, if I'm counting by hundredths, the next one's going to be 10 hundredths. Now once again, 10 hundredths is the same thing as one tenth, just the same way that 10 ones is the same thing as one 10. I hope that doesn't confuse you, but we could keep counting. 10 hundredths, 11 hundredths, 12 hundredths, 13 hundredths, 14 hundredths, 15 hundredths, 16 hundredths, and then finally 17 hundredths. So hopefully that gives you a little intuition for why we can call this number, instead of just calling it zero point one seven, or one tenth and seven hundredths, we could call this 17 hundredths. So with that out of the way, let's do a couple of examples going the other way. Let's say we're given a name of a number or the words, and we wanna write it down as a decimal. So this is four tens and three hundredths. Alright, so four tens. So the four tens right over here. So actually let me just put some places over here, so this would be, if this is our tens place, and then this is our ones place, and then you're gonna have your decimal, and then you're gonna have your tenths place, tenths place, and then you're going to have, and I'll do this in a different color, your hundredths place. Hun- Hundredths place. So we're going to have four tens. Not tenths, four tens. So four tens, zero ones, zero ones, we got our decimal, they don't have any tenths over here so zero tenths, and then we have three hundredths. Three hundredths, so three hundredths. So four tens, which is the same thing as 40, and three hundredths right over here, so 40 point zero three. Let's do another one of these, this is kinda fun. So we have 24 hundredths. 24 hundredths. So by the logic that we saw in the first one, in the first one, we could just write this as, remember, this would be nine hundredths, and if we want one more hundredth, this would be 10 hundredths. So if we want to do 24 hundredths, it would just be zero point two four. And if you're saying well wait a minute, this looks like two tenths and four hundredths, you'd be right! But remember, so actually let me, I could re-write this as, I could re-write this as two tenths, two tenths and four hundredths. Let me say and four hundredths. Hundredths. But remember, a tenth is equal to 10 hundredths, so two tenths is the same thing as 20 hundredths. Hundredths. I have trouble saying- So this is the same thing as 20 hundredths and four hundredths. And four, let me write it neatly. Four hundredths. And of course 20 hundredths and four hundredths is the same thing as 24 hundredths. So hopefully that makes sense.",

            "4:44": "Well, you can't do that simple-- well, first of all,",

            "5:55": "Let's move on to 6.",
            "5:58": "So 120 is equal to 6 times what?",
            "6:02": "Now, to be divisible by 6, you have to be",

            "6:07": "Now, we know that we're already divisible by 2 and 3,",
            "6:09": "so we're definitely going to be divisible by 6, and you",
            "6:12": "should hopefully be able to do this one in your head.",
            "6:14": "5 was a little bit harder to do in your head. but 120, you",
            "6:17": "could say, well, 12 divided by 6 is 2, and then you have that",
            "6:21": "0 there, so 120 divided by 6 would be 20.",

            "7:02": "You have a remainder, so it does not divide evenly.",

            "7:30": "8 goes into 12-- it doesn't go into 1, so it",

            "7:43": "8 goes into 40 five times.",

        "transcript": "Find all of the factors of 120. Or another way to think about it, find all of the whole numbers that 120 is divisible by. So the first one, that's maybe obvious. All whole numbers are divisible by 1. So we could write 120 is equal to is to 1 times 120. So let's write a factors list over here. So this is going to be our factors list over here. So we just found two factors. We said, well, is it divisible by 1? Well, every whole number is divisible by 1. This is a whole number, so 1 is a factor at the low end. 1 is a factor. That's its actual smallest factor, and its largest factor is 120. You can't have something larger than 120 dividing evenly into 120. 121 will not go into 120. So the largest factor on our factors list is going to be 120. Now let's think about others. Let's think about whether is 2 divisible into 120? So there's 120 equals 2 times something? Well, when you look here, maybe you immediately recognize that 120 is an even number. It's ones place is a 0. As as long as its ones place is a 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, as long as it's an even number, the whole number is even and the whole number is divisible by 2. And to figure out what you have to multiply by 2 to get 120, well, you can think of 120 as 12 times 10, or another way to think about it, it's 2 times 6 times 10, or 2 times 60. You could divide it out if you want. You could say, OK, 2 goes into 120. 2 goes into 1 no times. 2 goes into 12 six times. 6 times 2 is 12. Subtract. You get 0. Bring down the 0. 2 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 2 is 0, and you get no remainder there, so it goes sixty times. So we have two more factors right here. So we have the factors. So we've established the next lowest one is 2, and the next highest factor, if we're starting from the large end, is going to be 60. Now let's think about three. Is 120 equal to 3 times something? Well, we could just try to test and divide it from the get go, but hopefully, you already know the divisibility rule. To figure out if something is divisible by 3, you add up its digits, and if the sum is divisible by 3, we're in business. So if you take 120-- let me do it over here. 1 plus 2 plus 0, well, that's equal to 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 0 is 3, and 3 is definitely divisible by 3. So 120 is going to be divisible by 3. To figure what that number that you have to multiply by 3 is, you could do it in your head. You could say, well, 3 goes into 12 four times, and then you-- well, let me just do it out, just in case, just for those of you who want to see it worked out. 3 goes into 12 four times. 4 times 3 is 12. You subtract. You're left with nothing here. You bring down this 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 3 is 0. Nothing left over. So it goes into it forty times. And the way to think of it in your head is this is the same thing as 12 times 10. 12 divided by 3 is 4, but this is going to be 4 times 10, because you have that 10 left over. Whatever works for you. Or you can just ignore the 0, divide by 3, you get a 4, and then put the 0 back there. Whatever works. So we have two more factors. At the low end, we have 3, and at the high end, we have a 40. Now, let's see if 4 divisible into 120. Now we saw the divisibility rule for 4 is you ignore everything beyond the tens places and you just look at the last two digits. So if we're going to to think about whether 4 is divisible, you just look at the last two digits. The last two digits are 20. 20 is definitely divisible by 4, so 120 will be divisible by 4. 4 is going to be a factor. And to figure out what we have to multiply 4 by to get 120, you could do it in your head. You could say 12 divided by 4 is 3, so 120 divided by 4 is 30. So we have two more factors: 4 and 30. And you could work this out in long division if you want to make sure that this works out, so let's keep going. And then we have 120 is equal to-- is 5 a factor? Is 5 times something equal to 120? Well, you can't do that simple-- well, first of all, we could just test is it divisible? And 120 ends with a 0. If you end with a 0 or a 5, you are divisible by 5. So 5 definitely goes into it. Let's figure out how many times. So 5 goes into 120. It doesn't go into 1. It goes into 12 two times. 2 times 5 is 10. Subtract. You get 2. Bring down the 0. 5 goes into 20 four times. 4 times 5 is 20, and then you subtract, and you have no left over, as we expect, because it should go in evenly. This number ends with a 0 or a 5. Let me delete all of this so we can have our scratch space to work with later on. So 5 times 24 is also equal to 120, we have two more factors: 5 and 24. Let me clear up some space here because I think we're going to be dealing with a lot of factors. So let me move this right here. Let me cut it and then let me paste it and move this over here so we have more space for our factors. So we have 5 and 24. Let's move on to 6. So 120 is equal to 6 times what? Now, to be divisible by 6, you have to be divisible by 2 and 3. Now, we know that we're already divisible by 2 and 3, so we're definitely going to be divisible by 6, and you should hopefully be able to do this one in your head. 5 was a little bit harder to do in your head. but 120, you could say, well, 12 divided by 6 is 2, and then you have that 0 there, so 120 divided by 6 would be 20. And you could work it out in long division if you like. So 6 times 20 are two more factors. Now let's think about 7. Let's think about 7 here. 7 is a very bizarre number, and just to test it, you could think of other ways to do it. Let's just try to divide 7 into 120. 7 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 12 one time. 1 times 7 is 7. You subtract. 12 minus 7 is 5. Bring down the 0. 7 times 7 is 49, so it goes into it seven times. 7 times 7 is 49. Subtract. You have a remainder, so it does not divide evenly. So 7 does not work. Now let's think about 8. Let's think about whether 8 works. Let's think about 8. I'll do the same process. Let's take 8 into 120. Let's just work it out. And just as a little bit of a hint-- well, I'll just work it out. 8 goes into 12-- it doesn't go into 1, so it goes into 12 one time. 1 times 8 is 8. Subtract there. 12 minus 8 is 4. Bring down the 0. 8 goes into 40 five times. 5 times 8 is 40, and you're left with no remainder, so it goes evenly. So 120-- let me get rid of that. 120 is equal to 8 times 15, so let's add that to our factor list. We now have an 8 and now we have a 15. Now, is it divisible by 9? Is 120 divisible by 9? To test that out, you just add up the digits. 1 plus 2 plus 0 is equal to 3. Well, that'll satisfy our 3 divisibility rule, but 3 is not divisible by 9, so our number will not be divisible by 9. So 9 will not work out. 9 does not work out. So let's move on to 10. Well, this is pretty straightforward. It ends in 0, so we will be divisible by 10. So let me write that down. 120 is equal to 10 times-- and this is pretty straightforward-- 10 times 12. This is exactly what 120 is. It's 10 times 12, so let's write those factors down. 10 and 12. And then we have one number left. We have 11. We don't have to go above 11, because we already went through 12, and we know that there aren't any factors above that, because we were going in descending order, so we've really filled in all the gaps. You could try 11. We could try it by hand, if you like. 11 goes into 120-- now you know, if with you know your multiplication tables through 11, that this won't work, but I'll just show you. 11 goes into 12 one time. 1 times 11 is 11. Subtract. 1, bring down the 0. 11 goes into 10 zero times. 0 times 11 is 0. you're left with a remainder of 10. So 11 goes into 20 ten times with a remainder of 10. It definitely does not go in evenly. So we have all of our factors here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60 and 120. And we're done!",

        "transcript": "Which of the following numbers is a factor of 154? So when a number is going to be a factor of 154 is if we can divide that number into 154 and not have a remainder. Or another way of thinking about it-- a number is a factor of 154 if 154 is a multiple of that number. So let's look at each of these and see which of these we can rule out or say is a factor. So does 3 divide evenly into 154? Or, another way of thinking about it, is 154 a multiple of 3? Well you'll later learn that you could actually test whether something is divisible by 3 by adding up the digits. And if that's divisible by 3, then it's going to be divisible by 3. And so you see here, 1 plus 5 is 6. 6 plus 4 is 10. 10 is not divisible by 3. But if you didn't want to do that little trick-- and we have other videos where we go into more detail about that trick-- you can actually just divide 3 into 154. 3 doesn't go into 1. It does go into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15. Subtract. Then we have 0. Then you bring down a 4. 3 goes into 4 one time. 1 times 3 is 3. Subtract, and you have a remainder of 1. So 3 is clearly not a factor of 154, so we can rule that out. Now what about 5? Well, any multiple of 5 is either going to have 5 or 0 in the ones place. You see that if we write 5 times 1 is 5, 5 times 2 is 10, 5 times 3 is 15, 5 times 4 is 20, you either have a 5 or a 0 in the ones place. This does not have 5 or a 0 the ones place, so it's not going to be divisible by 5. 5 is not a factor. 154 is not a multiple of 5. Now 6 is interesting. You could do the same thing. You could try to divide 6 into 154. But if something is divisible by 6, it's definitely going to be divisible by 3 as well because 6 is divisible by 3. So we can immediately rule this one out as well. Because 154 is not divisible by 3, it's also not going to be divisible by 6. And you could try it out if you like. And we could make the same argument for 9. If something is divisible by 9, it's going to be divisible by 3 because 9 is divisible by 3. Well, it's not divisible by 3, so we're going to rule out 9 as well. So we've ruled out everything. It looks like 14 is our only option, but let's actually verify it. Let's actually divide 14 into 154. 14 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 15 exactly one time. 1 times 14 is 14. We subtract. We get 1. Bring down the 4. 14 goes into 14 one time. 1 times 14 is 14. And of course, we have no remainder. So 14 goes into 154 exactly 11 times. Or 11 times 14 is 154. 154 is a multiple of 14. Let's do one more. Which of the following numbers is a multiple of 14? So now we have 14, and we're trying to think of its multiples. So there's two ways of doing this. You could go number by number and try to divide 14 into them, or we could just try to figure out what all of the multiples of 14 actually are. So let's try to do that. Let's try to do that second technique. 14 times 1 is 14. You add another 14. 14 times 2 is 28. Add another 14. Let's see, you add 10. You get to 38. Then you add 4 more. You get to 42. Then you add another 14. I haven't seen any of these numbers show up yet. Add another 14 to this. You get to 56-- still not quite there. Add another 14. Let's see, if you add 4, you get to 60, and you have to add the 10. So then you get to 70. And it looks like we have found one of these numbers. 70 is a multiple of 14. 14 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- 14 times 5 is 70.",

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] Let's do some examples creating picture and bar graphs. So it says Mr. Smith assigned a special project about the ocean to the students in his Earth Science class. To find out if students who spend more time on their projects got better grades, he asked the students how much time they spent completing their projects. Create a bar graph to show how much time each student spent completing the ocean project. So James spent 36 minutes. So I'm gonna click here and I'm gonna move this up to 36. Eji spent 54 minutes. So I'm gonna move this up to 54 minutes. Then Minli spent 36 minutes. So I'm gonna move Minli up to 36 minutes. Then Simone spent 30 minutes. So I'm gonna move Simone up to 30. Then Kiran spent 12 minutes. So I'll move Kiran up to 12. And there you go, I have constructed the bar graph. Let's do a couple more of these. All right. So on Thursday, Ming went to see a loud and exciting performance by the Dinosaur Orchestra. Create a bar graph to show how many of each type of dinosaur were in the Dinosaur Orchestra. So I guess there were 42 Stegosaurus's. I don't know if that's a plural for Stegosaurus. So there are 42 Stegosaurus's, 63 Raptors. So we move the Raptor up to 63. 35 Triceratops. Then you had 49 Tyrannosaurus. 49 of these. So fairly straightforward. So let's do a couple more of these. All right, so now it tells us Rose's flower shop makes bouquets for special occasions. Each bouquet comes with a different number of flowers. Create a picture graph to show the number of flowers in each bouquet. So this is kind of like a bar graph, but instead we're gonna use pictures. Each picture shows a certain number. So in this case, a picture of a flower represents three flowers. So the Mother's day bouquet has 21 flowers. So 21 flowers. Now you might be tempted to put 21 pictures of flowers here, but you have to remember each of these flowers represent three flowers. So one way to think about it, you could count by threes. Three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21. So that over here, this right over here, would represent 21 flowers. And you notice I just made seven of this picture, and that makes sense because seven of these pictures, and each of these pictures represent three flowers, seven times three is 21. The Mother's Day bouquet has 21 flowers in it. All right, the Anniversary bouquet has 27 flowers. So three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27. I have nine flowers here. Nine times three is 27. The Birthday bouquet has 18. So three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18. And I just made six pictures here because each of them represent three flowers. Six times three is 18. Then finally, the Congratulations bouquet has 12 flowers in it. Three, six, nine, and 12. There you go. I think we're done. I think we're done. Let's do one more of these. All right. Barry Bee and his bee friends love to pollinate flowers. They created a chart and a picture graph to show how many flowers each of them pollinated today. Use the information in the chart to answer the question about the picture graph. So it says, On the picture graph, each flower equals blank flowers, or each picture of a flower, I should say, equals a blank number of flowers. So it says Barry pollinated 27. These are impressive bees that they sit there making charts. Barry pollinated 27 flowers, and they only drew three pictures here. So these three flower pictures must represent 27. So the way that they would represent 27 is if each of these represent nine because we'd have nine, 18, 27. So each of these must be nine flowers. But let's see if that works. So for Bumbly, 63. So let's see, nine, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63. Yep, it looks like it works out. Betty is one, two, three, four, five, six. Six, six times nine is 54. That is the number of flowers she pollinated. Bertie, one, two, three, four, five. If each of those pictures represent nine, then this would be five times nine is 45. That is the number of flowers Bertie had actually pollinated.",

So Bike World is right over here and we see that Bike World, if we just look at this right over here, Bike World has 19 bikes, has 19 bikes. And they wanted us to compare Bike World to Bikes R Us and say how many more bikes does Bike World have than Bikes R Us? So Bike World has 19, how many does Bikes R Us have? This is Bikes R Us right over here, Bikes R Us has, Bikes R Us has 12 bicycles. So how many more does Bike World have than Bikes R Us? Well we can just subtract Bikes R Us's number of bikes from Bike World's, 19 minus 12. What is that going to be? Well if we look at the ones place, nine ones minus two ones is seven ones, and then one ten minus one ten is no tens. I could write no tens there but I don't have to write that. So there's seven more bikes at Bike World than Bikes R Us. And you can also see it here.

        "transcript": "The base unit for distance in the metric system is the meter. And to get a sense of how long a meter is, the average human being is between 1.5 and 2 meters tall. So 1.5 meters would be a not-so-tall person, but 2 meters would be quite tall. In fact, if you're 2 meters tall or above 2 meters tall, you might want to consider basketball. So, for example, in this drawing right over here by Leonardo da Vinci, if this is an average-sized male, a meter, it would be more than half way across his wingspan. So it might be about that much. And obviously, I am just roughly drawing this, just to give you a sense of how far a meter might be. And I just wrote a lowercase m here as really just a short way of writing meter. So you could imagine that the smaller things you might want to measure with the meter are things like a human being-- a human being's height or a human being's wingspan. If you wanted to say, well, what are some of the larger things that you would want to measure with a meter, you might imagine something like the height of a skyscraper. So this right over here is the Empire State Building, at one time the tallest building in the world, now just a tall building in the world. And this is 443 meters tall. So this is starting to be on the larger scale of things that you would want to measure with a meter. Now you're probably asking, well, what happens if I want to measure things that are even larger than that? Well the metric system provides us prefixes to essentially say multiples of meters. And the unit of distance that is larger than the meter that is most typically used is the kilometer. I've heard a few people say \"kill-O-meter,\" but kilometer, I'll pronounce is \"kuh-LAW-me-ter,\" which is equivalent to 1,000 meters. And so when you're thinking about kilometers, this is thinking about the distance within a city. This would be even the distance from one city to another city. Even the radius of the planet is often measured in kilometers. And to once again get a sense of that, this right over here is a map of New York City. And right over here they give us the scale. This distance right over here is 5 kilometers. So 5 kilometers just to give us a sense of things-- and they wrote km for short so 5 km. This lowercase k, lowercase m is just shorthand for kilometers, this would be equal to-- well if 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, 5 kilometers is going to be 5 times as many. It's going to be 5,000 meters is this distance right over here. If you were to try to imagine 1 kilometer, it would be 1/5 of that. So 1 kilometer on this map might look something like that. Now there's other units in the metric system that allow us to describe distances less than a kilometer but more than a meter. But they're not as typically used. But I'll list them here, just so that you see that they exist. You have the \"hect-O-meter,\" or \"heck-TOM-eter\"-- it's so infrequently used that I really haven't heard a lot of people say it-- which is equal to 100 meters. And you have the \"DECK-a-meter\" or \"deck-AM-eter,\" and I actually think it's \"DECK-a-meter.\" Dekameter, which is 10 meters. And I'm going to write these in orange because they're not that frequently used. For example, it's not typical to hear someone say that the Empire State Building is 4.43 hectometers or for them to say that this is 44.3 dekameters. They would typically say that this is 443 meters. Now you're probably saying, OK, well, this is fine. Using these prefixes on the meter, I'm able to describe distances that are larger than a meter, that are multiples of tens of the meter or a multiple of 100 or a multiple of 1,000 of the meter. But what if I want to go smaller? Well, the metric system has units for that. And if we go just 1/10 of a meter, this is not used as typically, but I'll write it here-- the decimeter. The decimeter is 1/10 of a meter. Or another way of saying it is 1 meter is equal to 10 decimeters, lowercase dm for short. Once again, this is not so typically used. But if we go one scale even below that, we get to the centimeter, which is a heavily used unit. And here, the prefix centi means 1/100. So this is 1/100 of a meter. Another way of thinking about it-- 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters. And if you wanted to imagine the scale of a centimeter, you could imagine this frog right over here on this person's hand might be several centimeters long. So a centimeter on this drawing might be around that distance. Now if you want to measure things even smaller than that, we have another fairly common unit, and that is the millimeter. And the prefix milli here refers to 1/1,000. So it's 1/1,000 of a meter. Or another way of thinking about it is 1 meter is equal to 1,000 millimeter. Actually, let me just write m for short, just so we used to also seeing it that way. 1 meter is equal to 1,000 millimeters. And if you wanted to imagine how long or how far a millimeter is, you could go down the scale of things that are smaller than a centimeter. So these ants, for example, might be 3 or 4 millimeters long. So a millimeter in this drawing right over here might be something like that. The important thing to realize or just to conceptualize is you might want to use different units depending on the scale that you're measuring. And it's also useful to just realize what these typical prefixes refer to because we're seeing it used in distance here. They're all based on the base unit of distance. But when we're measuring volume or we're measuring other things in the metric system, these same prefixes also show up. So you see here when we're measuring distance, kilo refers to 1,000. A kilometer is literally 1,000 meters. Hecto refers to 100. A hectometer-- 100 meters. Deka refers to 10. Deci refers to 1/10. So decimeter, literally 1/10 of a meter. Centimeter-- 1/100, 1/100 of a meter. Milli refers to 1/1,000.",

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] What I want to talk about in this video is the liter. The liter. Let me write this down. The liter and the liter is a unit for measuring fluid volumes, or how much space does a fluid take up. So what does one liter look like? Well one of these milk bottles is a liter and your most typically going to think about a liter in your everyday life when your buying some type of beverages, milk, or water. In fact next time you go to the grocery store see a lot of the bottles you get. They might be exactly one liter, some of the soda bottles are two liters, but this right over here is one. One liter, we write a capital L for short, that's one liter and so there's six liters in total in this little carrying case but each of these milk bottles is one liter. So that's a liter but what if we want to go to really small volumes of water? Well if we want to go to really small volumes of water we normally talk about milliliters. Milliliters, let me write this down. Milli Milli Milliliters. Actually let me write it this way. Let me write milli in another color. Milli Milliliters. So it's a milli liter. And a milliliter, a milli is a prefix that you'll see a lot when your using units and that means one one-thousandth of a liter. So this means one one-thousandth. One one-thousandth of Of a of a liter and the notation for milliliter is a lowercase m and and uppercase L. Milli liter. Another way to think about it, it would take one thousand milliliters to get to one liter. So what does a milliliter look like? Well if you imagine these medicine droppers, a milliliter would be about that high on one of those medicine droppers and a lot of these medicine droppers actually will have a milliliter, actually they'll have up to five milliliters marked off but a milliliter will be about that much or if you were to take a teaspoon from your cabinet in your kitchen and you would scoop out a teaspoon of water, that, so this one over here is going to be one milliliter and a teaspoon of fluid, that's going to be about five. That's going to be about five milliliters. So another way to think about it is you would have to take a thousand of these drops to fill one of these bottles of milk. A thousand milliliters to get to one liter or you would have to do, let's see, five, you'd have to put five, sorry, you'd have to do two hundred teaspoons of say milk, to fill up this entire thing because each of them is five milliliters. Two hundred times five milliliters, you're going to have a thousand milliliters which is one liter. Let me write this down. This right over here, this is one liter which is the same thing as one thousand, one thousand milliliters. Now what if we go to things that are much larger. What if we go to things that are much larger than the scale of a jar of milk. Say a swimming pool and this right over here, this is a picture of a olympic size swimming pool which is, for the most part, the largest pools, well there some larger pools in some fancy hotel and things, but they're very large pools. So what do you think would be if one milk bottle has a, one like this, has a fluid volume of one liter, what do you think about a whole swimming pool? Well actually a swimming like this, if it is 25 meters wide and 50 meters long and two meters deep, it actually would have a fluid volume, are you ready for this? It would have a fluid volume of 2.5 million liters. So if you filled this up with milk, you can use that milk to fill up 2.5 million of these bottles. So that's just an appreciation for just how much fluid it would take to fill up at least a big swimming pool like this, an olympic size swimming pool. A swimming pool that you might more typically see at someone's house, who isn't, you know, that doesn't have an olympic size swimming pool so kinda of a house size swimming pool, it's still going to be, it's not usually to see one that will be more than one hundred, 100,000 100,000 liters. So once again, are you thinking about teaspoons or drops from a dropper, your thinking in the milliliter range. If you're thinking about the type of, something that you might drink in a day or that your family might drink over, say a week, you're thinking in, really, the liter range. And if you're thinking about how much fluid it would take to fill a swimming pool, now you're talking in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or even millions of liter range.",

She squeezed 42 millimeters of lemon juice from the first lemon. 36 milliliters of juice from the second lemon, and 45 milliliters of juice from the third lemon. How much lemon juice did Li MIn squeeze from her three lemons? Well we just have to add how many milliliters she got from each of them, add them all together. So from the first one, she got 42 milliliters 42, and short for milliliters I can write lowercase m for mili, and uppercase L for liters. 42 milliliters from the first lemon. 36 milliliters from the second lemon, and then 45 milliliters from the third lemon. So we can just add these three quantities together. So let's do that, let's add them together. So we're gonna get something in terms of milliliters. So let's go first to the ones place. Two plus six is eight, eight plus five is 13. 13 is three ones and one 10, so I could write that one 10 in the 10s place. So one plus four is five, plus three is eight, plus four is 12, so it's gonna be 12 10s. Which is the same thing as 120. So in total, Li Min squeezed 123 milliliters from her three lemons. Let's do another problem like this. Sarah poured five cans of motor oil into the container below. So this container below has 55, let's see this is halfway, it's filled up after she poured the five cans, and it's filled up halfway between 40 and 50, so this mark right here, this looks like that would be 45. So it's filled up to 45 milliliters. So she poured five cans, and those five cans combined ended up being 45 milliliters. All of the cans held the same amount of oil, and I guess we can assume that this container below was empty before she filled any of the cans in. So all of the cans held the same amount of oil. How many milliliters of motor oil were in each can? So she had five cans, so one, one can, two cans, three cans, four cans, and five cans. They each had a certain amount of oil in them. They each had a certain amount of oil in them. And when she put them all in, so let's say they each have a question mark of oil in them. So she had five cans, and they each had a question mark amount, say question mark milliliters of oil in it. And when you multiplied by five, when you put all five together you got 45 milliliters. You got 45 milliliters. So five times what amount of oil per can would get us to 45 in total? Well five times nine is 45. So this thing right over here, five times nine is 45. So Sarah had nine milliliters in each can, they each had the same amount, they say that. All the cans held the same amount of oil. So if she had nine milliliters in each one, notice, if in each of the five cans you had nine milliliters, five times nine is 45. So she had nine milliliters of motor oil in each can.",

        "transcript": "- So let's talk about the unit of measurement called the \"gram.\" And the gram is a unit of measurement for measuring mass. Now, what is mass? Well, you might have seen in everyday language, someone might look at a feather, let me see if I can draw a good feather. So a feather like this. And say, \"Hey, this is not very massive.\" This is not massive. And notice, you have that word \"mass\" in there. And then they might point to some big boulder, some big heavy boulder, let me draw a big heavy boulder. And say, \"This is massive.\" This is massive. And so, just with those examples, you might get an intuition for what mass is. It's how much stuff there is, and it's related to weight. And I said \"related to weight,\" not the same thing as weight, because later on when you take Physics, you will learn that mass and weight are related, but that they're not exactly the same thing. Now, if you're on a given planet, and the same distance from the center of that planet, roughly speaking, mass and weight will be strongly related to each other. Something with more mass is going to have more weight. Two things with the same mass, once again if I'm on the same planet, at the same distance from the center of the planet, they're going to have the same weight. So you'll often hear people say, \"How many grams does that thing weigh?\" They really should be saying, \"How many grams does that thing mass,\" but it's okay, because as long as we're staying on earth, roughly you know, at sea level, plus or minus a little bit, or even if we're a little bit further away from sea level, mass and weight, it's not crazy to hold them a little bit interchangeable. And one way to gauge something's mass is to hold it if you can, and say, \"Okay, how much does this weigh,\" because the more something weighs, the more its mass is going to be. The more something's mass is going to be, the more it's going to weigh, once again, assuming we're on the planet, etc., etc. When you take Physics class, you'll learn that they are different concepts that are closely related to each other. So, that's what a gram is. Now, another thing that you will see in the context of mass and measuring mass, is the kilogram. And all the kilogram is, and you're going to see the prefix \"kilo-\" over and over again, in your, I guess your education careers, especially when you're thinking about units. But \"kilo-\" is just a prefix for 1000. So that literally means 1000 grams. So instead of saying \"2000 grams,\" I could say \"2 kilograms.\" So with that out of the way, let's see if we can get a sense for what one gram or different numbers of grams of masses are and what might have a mass of one kilogram or 10 kilograms or 100 kilograms. And that's exactly why I got all of these pictures prepared. So if, if you want to get a sense of something that has a mass of one gram, think of a paper clip. And I have this little squiggly thing here, because that right there, that means \"roughly.\" Every paper clip isn't going to be exactly 1 gram; it might be 1 1/2 grams, it might be small paper clips that are 1/2 gram. But it gives you the sense of what would have a mass of 1 gram. And if you want to know how much something with a mass of 1 gram weighs on the surface of the earth, well, you could just hold that paper clip and kind of judge, feel how much it's pulling down on your hand. Now, or how much the weight of it is pushing down on your hand, I guess I could say. Now, if you want to get a sense of things that are little bit more massive, a pencil is five times as massive as a paper clip. And hopefully you'll see that, if you hold five paper clips on one side and a pencil on the other side, you'll see that they roughly have the same mass, and their weight will be roughly the same. Now, a little bit more massive, you could think of a field mouse. A field mouse is equivalent to the mass of roughly 4 pencils, or 20 paperclips. You want to get even more massive, you can think of a kitten. So, a kitten after a couple of weeks, it's still a kitten now, it's still not a fully grown cat, it'll have a mass of about 200 to 300 grams. And this makes a rough amount of sense, you can imagine this thing having the same mass as maybe 10 or 15 of these little field mice. You can imagine the mouse is about that size, right over there. I could do a better job drawing a mouse. But that makes some sense. So what if we get even larger? What if we get into the ranges of, say, 1000 grams? Well, now we can start talking about kilograms. And just to be clear, when I put a \"g\" here, that's just an abbreviation for \"gram.\" So this is 1 gram, 5 grams, 20 grams. And now, if you want to go to 1000 grams, you could think of something like a hard-cover textbook like this one. And they're obviously, some textbooks are huge, but the one that I'm showing here I didn't weigh or figure out the mass of this exact one. But it would have a mass of roughly 1 kilogram, or 1000 grams. So that's a kilogram right over there, 1000 grams. A fully grown cat, that's about 3 to 5 kilograms, depending on how fully grown it is or I guess how big of a cat it is. So, that's pretty interesting, a fully grown cat is more than 10 times the mass of a kitten. Actually that makes sense, most fully grown humans are more than 10 times their mass when they were very, very young, or actually roughly 10 times the mass of when they were very young, so it actually makes sense. Now, if you want to get even larger, you can go to a large ape, like a human being, in particular, this one right over here. 70 kilograms, and this is actually pretty close to my actual mass, 70 kilograms. And you get a sense of what that would mean if you're used to dealing with pounds. I weigh a little over 160 pounds, so that's about 70 kilograms.

And then, if you want to get even heavier, you would get 10 times more massive than a human being, than a normal-sized human being, you might get to something like this cow, and this cow would have a mass of 750 kilograms. So, how many paper clips would you need to have the same mass as this cow? Well, you might be tempted to say 750, but remember this is 1 gram, this is 750 kilograms. So the mass of this cow is actually 750,000 grams. So you would need about 750,000 of these paper clips to have the same mass as this cow.",

So one kilogram if you're used to dealing with pounds, one kilogram is 2.2 pounds. So seven kilograms is like 15 or 16 pounds.

All of her pencils have the same mass. Tina finds the mass of one pencil shown below. And it's eight grams. What is the total mass of five pencils? Well if one pencil is eight grams, five pencils are gonna be five times eight grams. Well five times eight is 40. It's going to be 40 grams. All right, this one seems similar. All of Sophia's Squirrel's acorns have the same mass. Sophia's squirrel finds the total mass of her four acorns shown below. What is the mass of one of the acorns?

So this is just a screenshot of that exact same screen we just saw there. And so let's just convert each of these into meters. So the first one we have right over here is one decameter. So we have to remind ourselves what deca even means. Well, deca is equal to 10 meters. And actually, let me add more of these, just so that we know all the different prefixes we could have. So you have deca. You have hecto, which would be 100. You have kilo, which would be 1,000. And then, of course, you just have meters, and you'd have no prefix there. That would just be equal 1 if you have no prefix in front of the meters. And then if you have a tenth of a meter, that is decimeter, so this is 1/10. Then you have centi, which is 1/100.

Another way of thinking about it is, look, 1,000 millimeters is equal to a meter. So let's divide this into groups of 1,000. Well, this is literally 15 groups of 1,000.

Well, 1,900 times 1 over 100 is 19, so this is equal to 19 meters. Another way of thinking about it is, this is 19 groups of 100 centimeters, and 100 centimeters is equal to a meter. This is 19 meters right over here. So let's go back to the actual problem. So let's remind ourselves. This right over here, this is 10 meters. This is 13 meters, so 10, 13.

But the order that they already gave it to was the order from smallest to largest. This is 10 meters, 13 meters, 15 meters, and 19 meters.",

        "transcript": "Let's say we have one ray over here that starts at point A and then goes through point B. And so we could call this ray-- let me draw that a little bit straighter-- we could call this ray AB. Ray AB starts at A, or has a vertex at A. And let's say that there's also a ray AC. So let's say that C is sitting right over there. And then I can draw another ray that goes through C. So this is ray AC. And what's interesting about these two rays is that they have the exact same vertex. They have the exact same vertex at A. And in general, what we have when we have two rays that have the exact same vertex, you have an angle. And you're probably already reasonably familiar with the concept of an angle, which I believe comes from the Latin for corner, which makes sense. This looks like a little bit of a corner right over here that we see at point A. But the geometric definition, or the one that you're most likely to see, is when two rays share a common vertex. And that common vertex is actually called the vertex of the angle. So A is the vertex. Not only is it the vertex of each of these rays, ray AB and ray AC, it is also the vertex of the angle. So the next thing I want to think about is how do we label an angle. You might be tempted to just label it angle A. But I'll show you in a second why that's not going to be so clear to someone, based on where our angle is actually sitting. So the way that you specify an angle-- and hopefully this will make sense in a second-- is that you say angle-- this is the symbol for angle, and it actually looks strangely similar to this angle right over here. But this little pointy thing, or it almost looks like a less-than sign. But it's not quite. It's flat on the bottom right over here. This is the symbol for angle. You'd say angle BAC. Or you could say angle CAB. In either case, they're kind of specifying this corner. Or sometimes you could view it as this opening right over here. And the important thing to realize is that you have the vertex in the middle of the letters. Now you might be saying, wait, why go through the trouble of listing all three of these letters. Why can't I just call this angle A? And to see that, let me show you another diagram. And although the geometric definition of an angle involves two rays that have the same vertex, in practice, you're going to see many angles that are made up of lines and line segments. And you could imagine that you could continue those line segments on and on in one direction. And then they would become rays. So in that way, they're consistent with this definition. But let's say I have one line segment that looks like that. Let me label some points here. So we've already used ABC. So I'm going to call this D and E, points D and E. So this is line segment DE. And let's say I also have a line segment FG. And let's say this point where these two line segments intersect, let's call that point point H. Now how could we specify this angle right over here? Can we just call that angle H? Well, no. Because if we just said angle H, the angle that has a vertex H, it could be this angle right over here. Or it could be this angle right over here. Let me draw it this way. You could view it that way. Or it could be that angle over there. It could be this angle over here. It could be this angle over here. Or it could be that angle over there. And so the only way to really specify which angle you're talking about well, is to give three letters. So if you really did want to talk about that angle right over there, you would call that angle EHG. So that is angle EHG. Or you could actually call that angle GHE. If you wanted to specify this angle right over here, the one made up of, if you imagine that ray and that ray, if you were to keep on going past those points, then you could call that angle DHG, or angle GHD. I think you get the point. This angle up here could be FHD or EHF. And this one could be FHD or DHF. And when you do it this way, it's very clear what angle you are referring to. So now that we have a general idea of what an angle is, and kind of how do we denote it with symbols, the next thing you might be curious about is, it doesn't look like all angles are kind of the same. It seems like some angles open up or are more open than others. And some are a little bit more closed in than others. And that actually is the case. So for example, let's take two angles here. So let's say I have one angle that looks like that. So I'll started reusing letters. So let's say that this is A, B and C. I could make these rays. I could keep on going and make them rays if I like. Or I could just keep them as line segments. So right over here, I have angle BAC. And let's say over here, I have angle-- so let me draw another one-- and let's say this is angle XYZ. And once again, I could draw them as rays if I like, to go on and on and on. So it's angle XY and Z. And so when you just look at these, you just eyeball these two angles, it looks like this one is more open. So this one looks more open. While this one over here looks more closed, at least relative to this one. So maybe when we measure angles, we should measure it based on how open or closed they are. And that actually is the case. And so without even telling you how we measure an angle, you could say that the measure of angle XYZ, the measure of this angle, is greater than the measure of this angle right over here. And any convention we use for measuring angles is essentially going to be a measure of how open or how closed an angle actually is. And I'll take that up in the next video where we'll see how to actually measure an angle.",

For example, image an open angle with point A on the first line and point B as the vertex (the point where the two lines intersect to form the angle) and point C on the other side. It's something like this:\n|\n|*A (imagine the dot is on that line)\n|\n| (imagine C is on this line lying down)\n*B _______*C_______\n(imagine B is where they touch each other)\n\nIf you can't visualize it then draw it on paper.\nSo the way we would call this angle is Angle ABC because the if you imagine drawing through the angle in one line you would start your line at point A and trace all the way to B, make a turn, and go to point C.\n\nDo you understand the first part? If not you can ask me again for more explanation :D\n\nOk now for the second way. We can name an angle simply by saying *angle [B]* (B is the vertex).This only applies when the vertex *DOES NOT INVOLVE IN OTHER ANGLES!* The graph above would be an example because the vertex B only form that one angle. BUT IN THIS EXAMPLE:\nFor example: Imagine two lines crossing each other, and B is the point where they cross.\nthe vertex point B forms a lot of angles.

        "transcript": "What I have right in front of me is the Khan Academy measuring angles exercise. I have a small part of it in this screen right over here. And it's a pretty cool exercise because it has this little virtual protractor that we can use to actually measure angles. And I want to give credit to the person who built this protractor, because I think it's pretty neat. Omar Rizwan, who was actually a high school intern, made this pretty neat module. And so in general, when you want to measure an angle, what you want to do is you want to put the center of your protractor at the center of-- or I should say, at the vertex of the angle. Or you want to put the vertex of the angle at the center of the protractor. And then what you want to do is either rotate the angle or rotate the protractor. In this case, we're going to rotate the protractor. You want to rotate the protractor so that the 0 angle, or kind of the 0 mark, is at one of the sides of the angle. And the other side of the angle is within the protractor. So let's try to do that. So maybe if we want to do that, this 0 side should be at this side of the angle. So let's rotate it that way. Let me just keep rotating it. If I could just keep it pressed. That's better. All right. That looks about right. So one side is at the 0 mark. And then my angle, my other side-- or if this was a ray, it points to, looks like, pretty close to the 20 degree mark. So I will type that in off the screen. You don't see that. And that is the right answer. And then we can get another angle. So let's try to measure this one right over here. So once again, place the center of the protractor at the center, at the vertex, of our angle. We can place the 0 degree, the base of the protractor, at this side of the angle. So let's just rotate it a little bit, maybe one more time. That looks about right. And then the angle is now opening up-- let's see, the other side is pointing to 110 degrees. So this is larger than 90 degrees. It's also an obtuse angle. The last one was an acute angle. This is obtuse, 110 degrees. More than 90 degrees. So let me type it in. I got the right answer. Let's do a couple more of these. So once again, put the center of the protractor at the vertex of our angle. And now, I want to rotate it. There we go. And this looks like roughly an 80 degree angle, not quite. If I have to be really precise, it looks like it's maybe 81 or 82 degrees. But I'll just go with 80 as my best guess. I got the right answer. Let's do one more of these. So once again, vertex of my angle at the center of my protractor. And then I want to put one side of the angle at the 0 degree. And I want to show you, there's two ways to do that. You could do this. You could do just this. But this isn't too helpful, because the angle is now outside. The other side sits outside of the protractor. So you want the 0 degrees on the side, so the other side is within the protractor. So let's keep rotating it. There we go. And then our other side opens up or you could say points to 70 degrees. So this is an acute angle right over here. So it is 70 degrees. So I'll leave you with that. Oh look, I'm ready to move on, the exercise tells me. And now we can start talking about more things about angles now that we know how to measure them.",

And then you'd want to rotate it so that, preferably, this edge, this edge at 0 degrees, is at one of these sides. So let's do it so that this edge right over here is right along this line. So let me rotate it. So then-- I've got to rotate it a little bit further, maybe one more. No, that's too far. So that looks about right. And then if you look at it this way, you can see that the angle-- and I don't have my Pen tool here. I'm just using my regular web browser-- if you look at the angle here, you see that the other line goes to 130 degrees. So this angle that we need to measure here is 130 degrees, assuming you can read sideways. So that is 130 degrees. Let me check my answer. Very good, I got it right. It would have been embarrassing if I didn't. Let's do the next question. I'll do a couple of examples like this. So once again, let us put the center of the protractor right at the vertex right over there. And let's get this 0 degrees side to be on one of these sides so that this angle will be within the protractor. So let me rotate it this way. And this really is pretty cool what Omar did with this module. So let's see. Let's do it one more time. That's too far. And so that looks about right. And then you can see that the angle right over here, if we look at where the other line points to, it is 40 degrees. Check answer-- very good. Let's do another one. This is fun. So let's get our protractor right over there. And you don't always have to do it in that same order. You could rotate it first so that the 0 degrees is-- and what you want to do is you want to rotate the 0 degrees to one of the sides so that the angle is still within the protractor. So let's rotate it around. So if you did it like that-- so you don't always have to do it in that same order. Although I think it's easier to rotate it when you have the center of the protractor at the vertex of the angle. So we have to rotate it a little bit more. So 0 degrees is this line. And then as we go further and further up, I guess, since this is on its side, it looks like this other line gets us to 150 degrees. And hopefully you're noticing that the higher the degrees, the more open this angle is. And so this one right over here is 150 degrees. And so let's do that-- 150. Let's do one more. Now let me show you what not to do. So what not to do is-- so you could put the center right over there. And you might say, OK, let me make the 0 go right over on this side, right over here. So if you did that, notice your angle would not be within the protractor. So you won't be able to measure it. And what you're attempting to do is measure this outer angle over here, which is an angle, but that's not the angle that this question is asking us to measure. This little arc over here is telling us that that's the angle that we need to measure. So that arc has to be within the protractor. So let's rotate this protractor a little bit more. I overdid it. And so this looks like this is 0 degrees, and then this right over here is 60 degrees. 60 degrees-- we got that one right, too. So hopefully that helps you with this module. It's kind of fun.",

        "transcript": "In this video, I really just want to introduce you to some terminology for some basic angle types. And the terminology I want to introduce you to are acute angles, right angles, and obtuse angles. And I think when we just go through these, they'll be pretty self-explanatory. An acute angle is an angle-- well, let me just draw them first. Then it might start to make sense. So an acute angle will look something like that. I draw two rays that are coming from a common point. So the acute angle will be this angle right over here. I could also draw an acute angle, maybe an angle that's formed from the intersection of two lines. This angle will be acute, and so will this angle. They're both acute angles. And we're going to see is acute angles are ones that are-- since I haven't defined right angles yet-- they're narrower. And what we're going to see is that they're smaller than right angles. Right angles are when the rays or the lines are going, I guess, in the-- I don't want to use the word, right, in my definition-- but if one is going horizontal, the other one will be going vertical. So let me draw it with the rays first. So the right angle, this one's going from the left to the right. Then the other ray is going from the bottom to the top. This angle right over here is a right angle. And I could label it like that, as a traditional angle. But the general convention for labeling right angles is to put a little, kind of a half of a box right over there. And that means that is a right angle. Or that if this is going left to right, this is going perfectly top to bottom, that this is in no way kind of-- I guess the best way to think about it and why it's called right is that this ray is completely upright, compared to this ray over here. And let me draw it with some lines. So if I have one line like this and then I have another line like that, a right angle over here-- actually all of these would have to be right angles-- it would mean that this line is completely-- if this was the ground, this line is completely upright, relative to this line over here. So either of these, that's what a right angle means. And now that we've defined right angle, I can give you another definition for an acute angle. An acute angle has a measure, or it's smaller, than a right angle. When you learn about radians and degrees, which are different ways to measure angles, you'll see that a right angle can be measured as 90 degrees. This over here is less than 90 degrees. So this is less than 90 degrees. And one way to conceptualize this is that this angle, its opening is smaller, it's more narrow, the lines are-- you would have to rotate one line less to get to the other line than you would over here. Here, you'd have to move it all the way over there. Here, you'd only have to move it a little bit. So the acute angle is less than a right angle. And so you might imagine already what an obtuse angle is. It is greater than a right angle. So let me draw a couple of examples of obtuse angles. So an obtuse angle might look like-- let me make it a little bit clearer. It might look like that. If this was a right angle, this line over here would look something like that. It would be completely upright relative to this if this were the ground. But we don't see that. This orange ray over here is actually opened out wider. It's opened up wider. So it is obtuse. And this kind of comes from the actual everyday meaning. Acute means very sharp or very sensitive. Obtuse means not very sharp or not very sensitive. So you could imagine this looks like a sharp point or it's not opening up much, so maybe it's more sensitive relative to other things, or I don't know. I'm just trying to make connections. This is less sensitive. It's all big and open. It won't be able to notice things that are small because I don't know. Maybe that's not an appropriate analogy. But one way to think about it, it's kind of open up wider, or it's bigger than a right angle. It's larger than 90 degrees if you measure it. You would have to rotate this ray more to get to this other ray than you would if they were right angles, and definitely a lot more than if they were acute angles. If I were to draw this with lines, which of the angles are obtuse and which are acute? Well, the way I've drawn them right over here, these two over here are acute, and then these over here are going to be obtuse. This one and this one, these are both obtuse angles. And I actually drew it up here, as well. This one and this one are going to be obtuse. So very simple idea. If one line or one ray relative to the other one is straight up and down, versus to left and right, or is completely upright, then we're talking about a right angle. If they're closer to each other, if you have to rotate them less, you're talking about an acute angle. If you have to rotate them more, you're talking about an obtuse angle. And I think when you just look at them visually, it's pretty easy to pick out.",

Well, maybe we don't know a special formula or a special equation to find width, but we do know one to find area of a rectangle, so let's use that formula and see how it can help us. We know that area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying the length of the rectangle, over here, the length, times the width. So if we multiply the two side lengths of a rectangle, we get its area. And on this picture, in this rectangle, we are told that our area is 80 square centimeters, so we already know the area, and we can use that to help us. We also know the length. We're told that this distance from here to here, this length is 10 centimeters, so the length is 10. Times the width, we don't know the width. That's what we're looking for. So what we do know though, is that we need our width to be a number that when it's multiplied times 10, we get 80 for an answer. So what number times 10 equals 80 is eight. Eight time 10 equals 80.

We're asked what is the length. But we do know that the width is four meters. So our length has to be some number that when it's multiplied times four, we get 24 for the answer.

And in fact, this one right here has the same height and width, so this is actually a square. So let's think about how much space they each take up on my screen. And since we're doing everything in terms of meters, since all of the dimensions are in meters, I'm going to measure the area in terms of square meters. So let's see how many square meters I can fit onto this yellow rectangle without going outside of its boundary and without overlapping. So I can fit 1 square meter. Remember, a square meter is just a square where its length is 1 meter and its width is 1 meter. So that's 1 square meter, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and 6 square meters. So we see here that the area is 6 square meters. Area is equal to 6 square meters. But something might be jumping out at you. Did I really have to sit and count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? You might have recognized that I could view this as really 2 groups of 3. And let me make that very clear. So, for example, I could view this as one group of 3 and then another group of 3. Now, how did I get groups of 3? Well, that's because width here is 3 meters. So I could put 3 square meters side by side. And how did I get the 2 groups? Well, this has a length of 2 meters. So another way that I could have essentially counted these six things is I could have said, look, I have a length of 2 meters. So I'm going to have 2 groups of 3. So I could multiply 2 times 3, 2 of my groups of 3, and I would have gotten 6. And you might say, hey, wait.

So based on what we just saw, let's take the length, 4 meters, and multiply by the width, and multiply by 2 meters. Now, 4 times 2 is 8. So this should give us 8 square meters. Let's see if this is actually the case. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- and you see it's going in the right direction-- 6, 7, and 8. So the area of this rectangle is, indeed, 8 square meters. And you could view this as 4 groups of 2. So you could literally view this as 4 groups of 2. That's where the 4 times 2 comes from. So you could view it as 4 groups of 2 like this. Or you could view it as 2 groups of 4, So 1 group of 4 right over here. So you could view this is 2 times 4, and then 2 groups 4. I want to draw it a little bit cleaner. Now, you could probably figure out what the area of this rectangle is. It's actually a square, because it has the same length and the same width.

The province is slowly letting small businesses open with restrictions. I am measuring the studio space later today and will have accurate numbers of what the square footage of the floor space is. What i need to do in the space to make it safe is go from a capacity of 100 people to 29 people. So, I need to fit 29 yoga mats in this space in an off center pattern. For example - the lay out would look like the off set dots on a dice of 5 dots. That pattern would be repeated within the space to make up 29 spaces or 29 yoga mats at equal distance apart. If I send you a drawing of the space would you be able to reconfigure the space to accommodate 29 yoga mats. I will also provide the size of the Yoga mat. What do you think of this ?

        "transcript": "When people use the word \"perimeter\" in everyday language, they're talking about the boundary of some area. And when we talk about perimeter in math, we're talking about a related idea. But now we're not just talking about the boundary. We're actually talking about the length of the boundary. How far do you have to go around the boundary to essentially go completely around the figure, completely go around the area? So let's look at this first triangle right over here. It has three sides. That's why it's a triangle. So what's its perimeter? Well, here, all the sides are the same, so the perimeter for this triangle is going to be 4 plus 4 plus 4, and whatever units this is. If this is 4 feet, 4 feet and 4 feet, then it would be 4 feet plus 4 feet plus 4 feet is equal to 12 feet. Now, I encourage you to now pause the video and figure out the parameters of these three figures. Well, it's the exact same idea. We would just add the lengths of the sides. So let's say that these distances, let's say they're in meters. So let's say this is 3 meters, and this is also 3 meters. This is a rectangle here, so this is 5 meters. This is also 5 meters. So what is the perimeter of this rectangle going to be? What is the distance around the rectangle that bounds this area? Well, it's going to be 3 plus 5 plus 3 plus 5, which is equal to-- let's see, that's 3 plus 3 is 6, plus 5 plus 5 is 10. So that is equal to 16. And if we're saying these are all in meters, these are all in meters, then it's going to be 16 meters. Now, what about this pentagon? Let's say that each of these sides are 2-- and I'll make up a unit here. Let's say they're 2 gnus. That's a new unit of distance that I've just invented-- 2 gnus. So what is the perimeter of this pentagon in gnus? Well, it's 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 gnus. Or we're essentially taking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 sides. Each have a length of 2 gnus. So the perimeter here, we could add 2 repeatedly five times. Or you could just say this is 5 times 2 gnus, which is equal to 10 gnus, where gnu is a completely made-up unit of length that I just made up. Here we have a more irregular polygon, but same exact idea. How would you figure out its perimeter? Well, you just add up the lengths of its sides. And here I'll just do it unitless. I'll just assume that this is some generic units. And here the perimeter will be 1 plus 4 plus 2 plus 2-- let me scroll over to the right a little bit-- plus 4 plus 6. So what is this going to be equal to? 1 plus 4 is 5, plus 2 is 7, plus 2 is 9, plus 4 is 13, plus 6 is 19. So this figure has a perimeter of 19 in whatever units these distances are actually given.",

        "transcript": "Let's say that today-- and we'll call today Day 1-- Day 1 is a Monday. What I want to figure out is what is the Day 300 going to be? What day of the week will Day 300 be? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that a little bit. So let's just write out the days of the week. You have Monday-- I'll do this in a different color-- you have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So if we had a lower number here, we could just fill this out. Monday is Day 1. Tuesday's Day 2. Wednesday, Day 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. I'll keep going. Day 8, well, that's going to be a Monday again. 9 10. I'm almost writing a calendar out. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So this is kind of useful. I could just write it out if I wanted to figure out something Day 16 or Day 20. I could just write that out. But this isn't that helpful if I want to figure out Day 300 or especially wouldn't be helpful if I wanted to figure out Day 3,000. So can I come up with some mathematical way of thinking about what Day 300 is going to be? Well, as you see when I started drawing this grid here, this grid has rows. And each row, you have seven days in it. And that makes sense. There are seven days of the week. So is there a way that if someone just gave you 16 without drawing this grid, then you would know that 16 is a Tuesday? Well, one way to think about it that might jump out at you is you could divide 16 by 7. That will tell you how many of these rows will come before 16. So 16 divided by 7 is 2. You have 2 rows before 16 right over here. You could get 7 into 16 2 times. And then you have a remainder. What is the remainder when you divide 16 by 7? 16 divided by 7 is going to be 2. 2 times 7 is 14. You're going to have a remainder of 2. So when we divide, we've historically cared more about this 2. We normally care more about well, how many times does it go into it. But now, the remainder is actually interesting. The remainder is really interesting here. Because the remainder tells you-- the first two just tells you 7 goes into 16 2 times. That's how many rows you have before getting to the 16. But then the remainder tells you in that row where is the 16? So the 16 is remainder 2. So the 16 is not the first. It's the second entry in the third row. And so it's going to be a Tuesday. Tuesday is the second day. I know what you're saying. Does that always work? Well, let's try it out with some other examples. Let's imagine Day 25. So let's just divide 25 by 7. So I'll do it right over-- I could do it. I'm going to make sure I have enough space. So if I have 7 goes into 25, it goes 3 times. 3 times 7 is 21. You have a remainder of 4. So let's see. So based on that-- so let me rewrite this-- so 25 divided by 7 is equal to 3, remainder 4. So based on this, if we were to write out the grid, we should have three rows of 7 before we get to the 25. And then 25 should sit in the fourth column. So if it's sitting in the fourth column, it should be a Thursday. So Day 25, based on this little math we just did, should be a Thursday. Let's see if that actually works out. So let's go to 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25. It is indeed a Thursday. But it makes complete sense. You could get seven rows in it before the row that gets to 25. And then in that row, it's going to be the fourth entry, because you have a remainder of 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. It's going to be a Thursday. So now we're ready to answer the question. What is Day 300 going to be? So let's just divide 300 by 7 and see where we get. 7 goes into 30 4 times. 4 times 7 is 28. Subtract, you get 2. Bring down a 0. 7 goes into 20 2 times. 2 times 7 is 14. And then we get our remainder. And now we care much more about the remainder. 20 minus 14 is 6. So our remainder is 6. So if we think about what day of the week it is, in its row it's going to be the sixth entry. It's going to be the sixth column. There's going to be 42 rows above it. But we care about which entry it is in its row. So Day 300 is going to be the sixth day of the week, the way we've written it out. It is going to be a Saturday.",

        "transcript": "I want to make little townhouse shapes with toothpicks. So this would be my first townhouse. I've used 3 toothpicks so far-- 4, 5, and 6. So that is my first townhouse. Now, let me make a little table here keeping track of things. So I'll do that in white. So here's my table to keep track of things. So this is the number of houses, and then this is the toothpicks that I'm using to make that house. So this first house here, took me 6 toothpicks-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now let's make our second house. And these are going to be townhouses. They're going to share common walls. So I'm going to add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks for my second house. Now, why did I only have to add 5 and not 6? Well, they shared a common wall here so I didn't have to add another toothpick here for this left-hand side wall. So starting with the first house, I really just had to add 5 toothpicks. I had to add 5 toothpicks to get to now 11 total toothpicks if I want two houses. I think you see the trend here. What about 3 of these? Well, this is going to be another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks. So we're going to add 5 again and get to 16. Let's do 4 just for good measure. So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5 gets us to 21. Now, I want to think about, can we, using this pattern, figure out how many toothpicks it would take for us to, say, make 50 of these townhouses or even 500 of these townhouses, or even 5,000 of them? Now we just have to look at this pattern here and see can we come up with an equation for each of these actual values? So, for example, we see a pattern that-- well, we already recognize that we started with 6, and we're adding 5 every time we add a house. So when you add the second house, you add 5 once. The third house, you start with 6, and you add 5 twice. The fourth house, you start with 6 and you add 5 three times. So let's actually write that down. So 21 is equal to-- you start with 6, you start with this 6 here, and then you add 5 three times, plus 5 times 3. When you had the 3 houses, once again, you started with 6 and you added 5 two times. Let me do that same color. And you added 5 two times. Plus 5 times 2. When you had 2 houses, you started with 6 again. This is equal to 6 and you added 5 once, so plus 5 times 1. And then when you had 1 house-- and it'll fit the same pattern-- you started with 6, and how many times did you add 5? Well, you didn't add 5. You could say that you added 5 zero times. So you might see a little pattern here. However many houses you needed, you take one less than that and multiply it by 5, add that to 6, and you get the number of toothpicks. And actually, let me rewrite this. So I could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 4 minus 1. I could write this as 6 plus 5 times 3 minus 1. You could write this as 6 plus 5 times 2 minus 1. You could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 1 minus 1. And maybe that makes a pattern a little bit clearer. This 4 is right over here. This 3 is right over here. This 2 is right over here. And then this 1 is right over here. So now, I think we are ready to think about what would happen if we wanted to make 50 houses. So let's try to do that. Let me do that in orange. This right over here is our 50th house. So this is the shared left wall it has. This is the 50th house right over here. So how many total toothpicks for 50 houses? So if we have 50 houses, well, we can use the pattern that we came up with. It's going to be equal to, starting with our 6, the first house requires 6. And then we're going to add 5 for each incremental house, so plus 5 for each incremental house. And how many incremental houses are there going to be? Well, there are going to be 50 minus 1 incremental houses. Why minus 1? Well, you already built one of them with the 6. Then for every extra one-- so there's going to be 49 extra houses-- you're going to add 5 toothpicks apiece. So this is going to be equal to 6 plus 5 times 49. And that is 245. So 6 plus 245 is equal to 251 sticks. And what's really neat about this pattern we just came up with is you could use it to figure out how many sticks you would need for a million of these little toothpick townhouses.",

        "transcript": "- [Instructor] So what we have in this chart is all the numbers from one to 100 organized in a fairly neat way. It's a somewhat intuitive way to organize it where each row you have 10, so you go from one to 10, then 11 to 20, then 21 to 30, all the way to 100. And what we're gonna look at is interesting patterns that might emerge from this. So if you look at what's highlighted here in this purplish color, what numbers are highlighted there? Pause this video and think about it. Well, what's highlighted are all of the even numbers. And you can see the even numbers form these nice, neat pillars or columns on this chart. And we can look at that and immediately start to see some patterns. For example, what numbers are always going to be in the ones place for an even number looking at this chart? Well, you can see in the ones place you're either always going to have a two in the ones place or you're going to have a four or you're going to have a six or you're going to have an eight or you're going to have a zero. So that ones place digit is always going to be an even number. Let's do another example. Here we've highlighted different numbers. So pause this video and think about what's true about all of the numbers that we've highlighted? Well, you might notice that these are all multiples of five. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, so on and so forth. And so these form these two columns on this chart. And here we can see very clearly that multiples of five are either going to have a five in the ones place like we have right over here. So they're either gonna have a five in the ones place or they're gonna have a zero in the ones place. You might've realized that before but you see it very clearly in these two, you see it very clearly in these two columns. Let's do one other example. This one is really interesting because it's not just one of those clean column-type patterns. It looks like we started one, and then we have this diagonal, then we go to 100. What's a pattern that could describe how we go from one number to the next, or another way of saying it, what's a rule for why we highlighted these numbers in purple? Pause the video and think about that. All right, well, one thing is if we go from one number to the next, you go from one to 10, we add nine. To go from 10 to 19, we add nine. To go from 19 to 28, we added nine. So each number is nine plus the previous one. And if you go all the way to 91, 91 plus nine is of course 100. Now, it's important to realize these are not multiples of nine because we started at one, not at zero. If you started at zero, you go zero, nine, 18, so forth and so on until you go nine, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81. Those would've been the multiples of nine. But everything got shifted because we started at one, not at zero. So we go from one and then 10, 19, 28, all the way down this diagonal and then we go back to 100. And so this is a really interesting thing to think about it. These are all the multiples of nine plus one is another way to think about it or this is if we started at one and we keep adding nines, these are all the numbers that we would highlight. But you can see a pattern. Whenever you add nine to a number, the value of the ones place decreases by one. You see that here as you go down these diagonals. You go from nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And even up here, we started at zero but you don't have a lower digit than zero so it just goes back to nine. So it goes zero, then goes up to nine, then it keeps going down, down, down, down, all the way until it gets to zero again and then it starts going down from there again. So once again, interesting patterns to look at. I encourage you to look at a chart like this and think about what patterns can you find?",

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] We are asked, \"What numbers should replace \"the A and B in the multiplication table?\" So let's just make sure we can read this multiplication table. The way you think about it is, if you wanted to figure out-- It goes up to six. So if you want to figure out what any number up to six times another number up to six is, this table will tell you. So for example, if you wanted to figure out what three times two is, you say, \"Ok, three. Let me take the row that has this three in it. \"And then the column for the two. \"So three times two.\" So if you're in this row, the three row, and you're in the two column, three times two is going to be six here. Or you could go the other way around. This 12, this means that 3 times 4 is 12. Or right over here, this 25. Notice, this is the same row as this five and the same column as that 5. So it's saying that five times five is 25. And so you notice that if you go in any row, you're counting by that number and if you go in column, you're also counting by that number. So for example, in this two's column right over here you're counting by twos. Two, four, six, eight. In this five column, you're counting by fives. Five, 10, 15, 20. And that makes sense because five times one is five. Five times two is 10. Five times three is 15. Five times four is 20. And the same thing is happening as you go up a row. Two, four, six, eight. Because two times one is two. Two times four is four. On and on and on, you're counting by twos. Here you're counting by sixes. Six times one is six. Six times two is 12. Six times three is 18. Six times four is 24. So hopefully now we understand the multiplication table. And it is actually pretty cool to just keep looking at it and thinking about how it works. But let's answer their question, what would A and B be? Well we have this A right over here. So one way to think about it, it needs to be whatever four times four is. And you might know that four times four is 16. Four times four is 16. Or another way is, you could just go down this column and count by fours. Four, eight, 12 and then you add four again. 12 plus four is 16. Now let's figure out what B is. And actually, let's do it that way. B is in this column so we can count by threes. Three, six, nine. Add three to that and you get to 12. So b could be 12. Or you could go from the row. You could go four, eight, add four to that and you get 12. And that makes sense because this, where B is, that should be whatever four times three is. Cause four times three is 12. Then they say, \"Complete the inequalities \"with the greater-than, less-than or equal symbol.\" So A is greater than B. Greater than. And I always remember the greater than symbol because it is opened to the number on left. The number on the left is greater than, it's opened to larger number. A is greater than B because four times four is going to be greater than four times three. Is greater than four times three. All right, four times four is greater than four times three. It makes sense. If four times four is four fours and if four times three is three fours, you have more fours here. So hopefully that makes sense. Let's do a couple more of these. So now what number should replace A and B in the multiplication table? So same idea. So A should be whatever four times five is. So it should be 20. Or you could look at whatever row or column it's in. If you look at its column, five, 10, 15, 20. Now let's do the same thing for B. B should be whatever five times four is. Well that's going to be 20 as well. That's going to be 20. And you could say, \"Well look, A is gonna be \"four times five which is 20. \"And B is gonna be five times four which is 20.\" So either way you look at it, they are the same. So, complete the inequalities? Well, A is equal to B because four times five is the same thing as five times four. It doesn't matter what order you multiply them in. Let's do one more of these. I think you're getting the sense of it. So what is A? So we see where it's located, it's in this row for this two and the column for the six. So it needs to be whatever two times six is. Which is 12. And you could count by sixes. Six, 12. Or you could count by twos. Two, four, six, eight, 10, 12 to get to A. Now B, this is going to be whatever six times 2 is. Well, that's gonna be 12 again. And so it's just like the last one we saw. A is gonna be equal to B because two times six is equal to six times two. Let's do one more, this is actually a lot of fun. All right, so A is whatever four times one is which we know is gonna be four. B is gonna be whatever one times four is which is also gonna be four. And I think you see a pattern here. A equals B because four times one is the same thing as one times four.",
