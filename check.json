        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] Compare 98,989 and 98,899. So we want to compare these two numbers and to do that, let's first think about what these digits mean. What do these numbers actually mean? Looking first at our number on the left, we have a 9 all the way to the right, or in the ones place value, which means just that. It means nine ones. Beside that, we have an 8 in the 10s place value, so that's eight 10s or 80. This number, these two right here, 89 is the same as an 80 plus a 9. Beside the 8, we have a 9 in the 100s place value, so again, we can look at that, 989 is the same as a 900 plus an 80 plus a 9 and let's keep going and fill in these last two. We have an 8 in the 1,000s place, and finally, a 9 in the 10,000s place, which means nine 10,000s or 90,000, so 98,989 is the same as 90,000 plus 8,000 plus 900 plus 80 plus 9. Which of these place values now seems like the most important one if we're deciding how big a number is? Which one of these has the biggest impact on the size of our number? And the answer is the one all the way to the left, whatever place value is farthest to the left is the greatest place value, so it is the most important in deciding how big or how small a number is. So when we compare these numbers, we're going to start by comparing the largest place value that either of them has. In this case, 10,000s is the largest place value both of them has, and in both cases, it's a 9, so both of these numbers start with 90,000 which is equal, we can't tell yet which one is greater, so we're going to move to the next biggest place value. The next largest place value is the 1,000s and again, we can see in both cases, we have an 8 or 8,000, so looking at what we've compared so far, these numbers are identical, neither is larger than the other, so we're going to keep going and again, we're going to pick the next largest place value, which is the 100s and our first number on the left, we have nine 100s, nine 100s, but on the right, we have eight 100s, so eight 100s is less than nine 100s, so this number on the right is less than our first number, the number on the left, or we could say, the 900 is greater than 800 so the number on the left is greater and this is our greater than symbol because we want the open side to be facing the larger number. We want the open side facing the larger number. So we'd read this as 98,989 is greater than 98,899. And you might be thinking, but wait, we didn't look at the 10s and look at the 10s. Here, we have eight 10s, but on the right we have nine 10s. Well, nine 10s is definitely greater than eight 10s but it doesn't make up for having less 100s. 100s are far bigger, 10 times bigger, than 10s, so they matter more, they had a bigger impact on which of these numbers was larger. So, we compare until we find the greatest place value that's different and then whichever of those has the greater number in that place value is the greater number. Let's try one more. So here we're comparing 53,000 and 350,000. At a quick glance, you might be thinking, okay, first number 5, first number 3. The highest place value is bigger here, it's a 5. But that's not quite enough. We still have to be sure we're comparing the same place values. This largest place value here, this 5, is in the 10,000s place. But the largest place value over here, the 3, is in the 100,000s place. So we are actually comparing 300,000 to 50,000. Those are two different place values. We want to compare 100,000s to 100,000s, so looking over here, how many 100,000s did this number have? And the answer is a great, big zero. It has zero 100,000s, so we can say zero 100,000s and when we compare that to 300,000, that's far less. No 100,000s is much less than three 100,000s, so actually, this second number is larger, so be careful not just to compare the first number but the largest place value, and if there's no digit in that place value, we can fill in a zero and then compare. So to read this, we'll say 53,000 is less, less, than 350,000, and this symbol is less than because the larger side is open to the bigger number and the bigger number is the second number, so 53,000 is less than 350,000.",

            "2:38": "Let's first look and actually pause the video",
            "2:40": "and try to solve it on your own.",
            "2:42": "Alright, so if we first look at the 1,000's place.",
            "2:44": "Remember, we start at the largest place value,",
            "2:47": "so the 1,000's place,",
            "2:48": "they all have exactly two 1,000s,",
            "2:50": "so now we move on to the 100's place.",
            "2:52": "So, what the polar bear and crocodile",
            "2:55": "has two 100s but the giraffe only has one 100,",
            "3:00": "so the giraffe is the lightest.",
            "3:02": "And remember, we're ordering from lightest to heaviest",
            "3:04": "because this has the least number of hundreds.",
            "3:06": "They all have the same number of thousands,",
            "3:08": "and so then we move one space to the right",
            "3:11": "to the 100s and the giraffe has the least number of 100s.",
            "3:14": "So, the giraffe is going to be the lightest.",
            "3:18": "And so, let's think about between the polar bear",
            "3:20": "and the crocodile.",
            "3:22": "They both have the same number of 1,000s,",
            "3:24": "they have the same numbers of 100s,",
            "3:26": "they have the same number of 10s",
            "3:29": "but notice, the polar has more ones than the crocodile.",
            "3:33": "And so, the polar bear is heavier,",
            "3:36": "so the crocodile comes next,",
            "3:38": "it's the next heaviest or the next lightest,",
            "3:41": "crocodile",
            "3:42": "and then the heaviest is the polar bear.",
            "3:46": "The polar bear.",
            "3:48": "you start at the largest place value, you compare.",
            "3:52": "They were the same.",
            "3:53": "Oh, there's a difference,",
            "3:54": "so this one must be lighter.",
            "3:55": "Doesn't matter what happens in the 10s and ones",
            "3:57": "because it has fewer 100s",
            "3:59": "than these right over here.",
            "4:00": "And so, if you were sorting these around",
            "4:02": "you would want to put the giraffe first",
            "4:06": "and then you would put the crocodile,",
            "4:09": "and then the polar bear would stay last,",
            "4:11": "so actually you would just swap,",
            "4:13": "you would just swap these two right over here.",
            "4:15": "Let's do one more.",
            "4:16": "This is a lot of fun.",
            "4:18": "Alright.",
            "4:20": "Let me scroll down a little bit.",
            "4:23": "Pause this video now",

            "4:39": "but not as tall as Mount Alverstone.",
            "4:41": "So, it is between Mount Alverstone and Mount Massive.",

            "4:57": "Enter a whole number solution.",
            "4:59": "So, we just have to think of a number",

            "5:05": "and smaller than 14,400.",
            "5:08": "Well, one possibility is we'll just add one",
            "5:12": "to Mount Massive.",
            "5:13": "So, one possibility is 14,429.",
            "5:17": "That would be taller than Mount Massive",
            "5:20": "but not as tall as Mount Alverstone.",
            "5:24": "Even though it has more ones than Mount Massive,",
            "5:27": "everything else is the same,",
            "5:28": "it has fewer 100s than Mount Alverstone.",
            "5:30": "So, that could be.",
            "5:31": "We could write 14,429.",
            "5:34": "We could have also written 14,430",
            "5:37": "and we could have kept going",
            "5:39": "all the way until 14,499.",
            "5:44": "They want us to enter a whole number solution.",

        "transcript": "- [Instructor] Two baseball teams are comparing the number of fans who attended their most recent games. The attendance at the Stanleyville Sliders' game was 12,896 fans. The attendance at the Benson Bats' game was 12,901 fans. Which team had more fans at their game? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Alright, let's work through this together now. Stanleyville Sliders. They tell us Stanleyville Sliders' game was 12,000, 12,896 and there's a reason why I'm writing it really large right over there. And then we see at the Benson Bats' game was 12,901. 12,901. So, the way I like to compare numbers is I go to the largest place value first and I compare. Well, let's see. They both have one 10,000. So, they have the same number of 10,000s, they have the same number of 1,000s, but then when we get to 100s, notice, Benson Bats has more 100s than Stanleyville Sliders. It doesn't matter what happens in the 10s and ones place. If they have more 100s over here. So, Benson Bats this is a larger number. So, which one has more fans at their game? Benson's Bats, and once again, I started at the largest place value, I start at the 10,000's place. It was the same. Then I move onto the next place. It's the same. Then I move onto the next place but now in the 100's place Benson's Bats is larger. So, I know that Benson's Bats has more fans than Stanleyville Sliders. I could write this as 12,901 is greater than, and I always remember the sign by saying hey, it opens to the larger value, so this is gonna be greater than 12,896. And you can even just think about it. Just keep counting. 12,896, 12,897, 12,898, 12,899, 12,900 and then 12,901. Alright, let's do another example. The table shows the weights of several animals at the zoo. Put the animals in order from lightest to heaviest. The lightest animal should be on the top of the list. And so, you can see it right over here, they gave us these three animals, and if you're doing this on Khan Academy you'd be able to click on these and move them around but I just copy and pasted the actual image. So, let's just think about these wights. So, let's do the same thing. Let's first look and actually pause the video and try to solve it on your own. Alright, so if we first look at the 1,000's place. Remember, we start at the largest place value, so the 1,000's place, they all have exactly two 1,000s, so now we move on to the 100's place. So, what the polar bear and crocodile has two 100s but the giraffe only has one 100, so the giraffe is the lightest. And remember, we're ordering from lightest to heaviest because this has the least number of hundreds. They all have the same number of thousands, and so then we move one space to the right to the 100s and the giraffe has the least number of 100s. So, the giraffe is going to be the lightest. And so, let's think about between the polar bear and the crocodile. They both have the same number of 1,000s, they have the same numbers of 100s, they have the same number of 10s but notice, the polar has more ones than the crocodile. And so, the polar bear is heavier, so the crocodile comes next, it's the next heaviest or the next lightest, crocodile and then the heaviest is the polar bear. The polar bear. Now once again, you start at the largest place value, you compare. They were the same. Then you go to the next largest. Oh, there's a difference, so this one must be lighter. Doesn't matter what happens in the 10s and ones because it has fewer 100s than these right over here. And so, if you were sorting these around you would want to put the giraffe first and then you would put the crocodile, and then the polar bear would stay last, so actually you would just swap, you would just swap these two right over here. Let's do one more. This is a lot of fun. Alright. Let me scroll down a little bit. Pause this video now and see if you can solve this. The table shows the elevations for three mountains in North America. Abby is trying to guess the elevation of University Peak. She knows that it is taller than Mount Massive but not as tall as Mount Alverstone. So, it is between Mount Alverstone and Mount Massive. So, it is right over here. Taller than Mount Massive but not as tall as Mount Alverstone. Alright. Fill in the blank with an elevation Abby could guess for the elevation of University Peak. Enter a whole number solution. So, we just have to think of a number that is larger than 14,428 and smaller than 14,400. Well, one possibility is we'll just add one to Mount Massive. So, one possibility is 14,429. That would be taller than Mount Massive but not as tall as Mount Alverstone. Even though it has more ones than Mount Massive, everything else is the same, it has fewer 100s than Mount Alverstone. So, that could be. We could write 14,429. We could have also written 14,430 and we could have kept going all the way until 14,499. They want us to enter a whole number solution. So, any of these would have been acceptable answers.",

            "3:00": "so to go from thousand to a lakh you",
            "3:02": "have to multiply by 10 twice which is",
            "3:05": "just 110 times 10 so you will need a",
            "3:10": "hundred hundred thousand rupee notes so",
            "3:18": "maybe this is the note this is how the",

            "3:24": "a hundred of these to get one lakh",
            "3:26": "rupees now we could go bigger than this",
            "3:30": "so if I were to say what what happens if",
            "3:33": "I take this number and multiply it by by",

            "4:37": "you don't notice that to get 10 lakh",
            "4:39": "rupees you actually need 10 times 10",
            "4:42": "times 10 or thousand you need thousand",
            "4:48": "thousand rupee notes so if you get a",
            "4:52": "thousand rupee note and then you get",
            "4:53": "thousand of those then you have 10 lakh",
            "4:58": "rupees now another question you can",
            "5:01": "think about is that if this so happens",
            "5:02": "this Bank is like pretty crazy and if",
            "5:05": "they give this to you in hundred rupee",
            "5:06": "notes so if they give you 1 lakh in",
            "5:09": "hundred rupee notes then how many",
            "5:11": "hundreds do we need think about that",
            "5:14": "question so now you know exactly how big",
            "5:17": "a lakh is it is a hundred times a",
            "5:20": "thousand so take a thousand make it a",
            "5:22": "hundred times bigger then you get a lakh",
            "5:24": "or you take a hundred and make it a",
            "5:26": "thousand times bigger because you get 10",
            "5:29": "times 10 times 10 so 100 rupees taken",

            "5:41": "one of the combinations so you can pick",
            "5:42": "whatever you want to so now that you",

            "5:50": "you probably know that a crore is much",
            "5:52": "bigger than a lakh but how big is it",
            "5:56": "really so let's do that let's actually",
            "5:59": "take the numbers I've been very left off",

            "7:09": "then of course a lakh and then now it's",

            "8:50": "you can do that",
            "8:52": "by looking at okay hundred thousands",
            "8:54": "make one lakh and I need hundred lakhs",
            "8:56": "to make one crore so I have to take",
            "8:59": "hundred thousand rupee notes and then",
            "9:02": "have hundred of them so 100 times 100 so",

            "9:19": "have a hundred thousand in them so one",
            "9:20": "more 0-0 thousand rupee notes so let's",
            "9:24": "maybe these are a thousand rupee notes",
            "9:26": "that's how they look there's a thousand",
            "9:29": "written on them so you have ten thousand",
            "9:31": "of these and then that means that you",
            "9:33": "have one crore rupees so I hope that you",
            "9:36": "have a good intuition now for how big",
            "9:38": "crore is and how big a lakh is and how",
            "9:40": "they compare to smaller numbers like",
            "9:43": "thousands and hundreds"
        },
        "transcript": "so you may have heard of a lack this word a lack you you'da seen maybe that something costs some lux maybe it's a car maybe it's a house and then you may have seen something costing crores sometimes these very big houses cost crores and then you know that these are big numbers right but if I ask you how big are they really how big are they for example in comparison to some number like thousand that wasn't is a it's a big number but a lakh is a much bigger number but how bigger how much bigger is it really so if I for example ask you hey give me one lakh but then give it to me in thousand rupee notes then how many thousand rupee notes do I give to make it 1 lakh let's look at answers to questions like these and to begin let's see the numbers that are not so big like this is a hundred and then if I do this if I had three zeros and get a four digit number that's a thousand and that's the thousand and then if I have one two three four four zeros then this is basically thousand multiplied by ten right take three zeros thousand multiplied by ten you get ten thousand and that's what we call this 10 times thousand or just ten thousand let's say I write it like this 10 ten thousand I have no idea why only the ten is capitalized but yeah ten thousand and then now let's take this even further if I make this one zero zero zero zero there are four zeros plus one more zero so this is my first six digit number oh this is a big number so what is this really it's thousand multiplied by ten so I'm just gonna put a multiplied by ten sign over here to get ten thousand multiply it by another ten to get this right so it's ten thousand multiplied by ten so ten times ten thousand or a hundred thousand right I can call this a hundred thousand it so happens that in our Indian system we call this one one lakh one luck so one lag is basically this number one followed by one two three four five zeros now we already have the answer to the question that we are looking for which is if I have to pay in thousand rupee notes then how many thousand rupee notes will I give to give to get one lakh rupees so you go to the bank and then you withdraw one lakh rupees and you want to check if this is correct then how many thousand rupee notes are there you know their INR I'll probably put INR over how many such notes and to do that you can just look here and you can see that thousand multiplied by 10 gives you ten thousand and then ten thousand multiplied by another ten gives you one lakh so to go from thousand to a lakh you have to multiply by 10 twice which is just 110 times 10 so you will need a hundred hundred thousand rupee notes so maybe this is the note this is how the note looks like let's say then you need a hundred of these to get one lakh rupees now we could go bigger than this so if I were to say what what happens if I take this number and multiply it by by ten then you'll get one zero zero zero zero zero zero have i drawn at one two three four five and then one two three four five six here right and what is this this number is what we call say it's a lakh multiplied by 10 so you can guess what the name could be right in this case we call this 10 lakhs so a thousand ten thousand one lakh 10 lakhs and just so that we don't leave out a poor or a hundred over we'll just call this as well this is a hundred so one hundred thousand ten thousand one lakh 10 lakhs you keep multiplying by 10 to get to the next number so now there are a few more questions we can ask if you wanted to give 10 lakh rupees to somebody then how many thousand rupee notes do you need take a couple of minutes think about it on your own do exactly what we did over here and you can get the answer and if you did that you don't notice that to get 10 lakh rupees you actually need 10 times 10 times 10 or thousand you need thousand thousand rupee notes so if you get a thousand rupee note and then you get thousand of those then you have 10 lakh rupees now another question you can think about is that if this so happens this Bank is like pretty crazy and if they give this to you in hundred rupee notes so if they give you 1 lakh in hundred rupee notes then how many hundreds do we need think about that question so now you know exactly how big a lakh is it is a hundred times a thousand so take a thousand make it a hundred times bigger then you get a lakh or you take a hundred and make it a thousand times bigger because you get 10 times 10 times 10 so 100 rupees taken thousand times a thousand hundred rupee notes gives you 1 lakh rupees again and you can keep playing this game I'm just picking one thing here you know picking one of the combinations so you can pick whatever you want to so now that you know these numbers what about this guy you probably know that a crore is much bigger than a lakh but how big is it really so let's do that let's actually take the numbers I've been very left off which was one zero zero zero zero this was ten thousand this was a lakh lakh so one followed by five zeros is a lakh one followed by six zeros is 10 lakhs and this is what we call them in India in the International System we call this a million and you will learn about this in the next set of videos but for now you just can take this as 10 lakhs and then you have and I'm gonna write this in like nice big letters 1 2 3 4 5 6 like one followed by a seven zero so this is my first eight digit number this is a big number eight digit digit yeah so you have one followed by seven zeroes and this is what we call one crore why am I putting a box around it because this is the largest number that we have in the Indian system so there is no more new names to learn that's a good thing right so you learned hundred then you learn 2,000 then you learnt 10,000 and then of course a lakh and then now it's a crore and that's it anything more it'll just be ten crores 100 crores thousand crores maybe even a lakh crores but you don't have a new name after this so looking at this what can you see you can see that I will take this color yeah let's take white then you can see that to go from lakh to 10 lakhs I multiplied by 10 and then to go from 10 lakhs to a crore I multiply by another 10 so how big is a crore really a crore 1 crore is equal to a hundred lakhs that's a hundred lakhs so ik lor is a hundred times bigger than a lakh which in turn is a hundred times bigger than a thousand so hundred thousands give you a lakh this is actually I mean I think the way I've written it is confusing so I'm gonna take this down so I'm gonna write one lakh equals a hundred thousand so one crore equals 100 lakhs one lakh equals one hundred thousand so now I'm gonna ask you a question that I'm tempted to ask now that you know how big a crore is how big a lacus in terms of numbers that you're already familiar with like thousand and hundred then ask you somebody has to give you one crore rupees right and they decide to give it to you in thousand rupee notes then how many thousand rupee notes will they give you it'll take a long time for you to count but how many will they give you you can do that by looking at okay hundred thousands make one lakh and I need hundred lakhs to make one crore so I have to take hundred thousand rupee notes and then have hundred of them so 100 times 100 so you're gonna get one crore will be one glory quills a hundred from here and another hundred from here maybe I can even 100 lakhs and each of those lakhs have a hundred thousand in them so one more 0-0 thousand rupee notes so let's maybe these are a thousand rupee notes that's how they look there's a thousand written on them so you have ten thousand of these and then that means that you have one crore rupees so I hope that you have a good intuition now for how big crore is and how big a lakh is and how they compare to smaller numbers like thousands and hundreds",

            "5:03": "ten Lux and so if you were to ask if I",

        },
        "transcript": "so if I have a hundred with me and if I multiply that by ten then I get a thousand if I multiply that by another ten I get 10,000 10,000 and if I multiply that by another ten I get one lakh for five that's a lakh and if I multiply this by another ten then I get ten lakhs and I've got one more zero I hope I'm doing this correctly two zeros three zeros four zeros five zeros six zeros and you're probably familiar with this and then I finally go to my number of one zero zero zero zero zero zero one two three four five six seven all right so these are as large as the numbers we will mostly see and of course numbers can keep going forever and ever and ever but you know that all these have names in the Indian system so if I use green for the Indian system then I know this is 100 I'm going to write just a hitch for this this is a thousand this is our 10,000 so I'm gonna write t th 10,000 this is a lakh this is 10 lakhs and this is a crore and with this maybe you should write crore in capital so just a big guy so one hundreds thousands ten thousands lakhs 10 lakhs and crore and this is what we do in the indian system and what's interesting here if you notice is that to go from a thousand to a lakh you multiply by I'm gonna do this here by a hundred by a hundred so hundred thousands is a lakh and then you do the same thing to go from a lakh to a crore so you do a hundred to go from a lakh to occur so 100 lakhs makes a crore all right so starting from thousands a hundred times is a lakh and a hundred times again as a crore now this is the Indian system but if you go abroad and if you happen to talk to people who are not from India maybe they won't even know what Urlacher's and what akrura's we use these words a lot in India like if there is a corruption scandal we say that it was so many lakh crores corruption and then I don't even know how many zeroes go in it but then for somebody outside we might say it was some million millions of rupees or sometimes billions of rupees of corruption maybe a more positive example would be that you know the entire businesses and all that is worth millions and billions of rupees or dollars you know in terms of currency so million is one word a billion is another word it don't know why if I write capital it looks better yeah millions and billions and these are very big numbers just like lakhs and crores were very big numbers but then we still don't know how big they really are right so how big is a million in terms of thousands in terms of lakhs then compared to lakhs is a million bigger or is it smaller it's a billion bigger than a lakh is it smaller than a crore or is it bigger than a crore so let's try and answer these questions so I'm gonna remove these hundreds over here because you already know them so now we're gonna use these same numbers if you notice these numbers don't change they don't care like one followed by two zeros is always ten times smaller than one followed by three zeros and this keeps going on this relationship of multiplying by ten is always a constant the only thing that changes with respect to countries is what we call these numbers just the names so maybe I can use orange foil for what we do internationally so the good thing is that even internationally this number is still called a hundred and this number is still called eight thousand thousand maybe I should just stick to D thousand and this number internationally is also called ten thousand so till here we are the same India and the rest of the world is exactly the same it's starting from here that the difference starts coming so in India we call this a lakh right what is the lakh really it's a thousand multiplied by let's take this color again let's a thousand multiplied it by 10 multiplied by 10 so a hundred thousand is what we call a lakh in the international system the good thing or sums of the interesting thing is that they call this just a hundred thousand a hundred a hundred thousand so you start from thousand ten times that ten thousand ten times that again is one hundred thousand that's it you don't need a new word called luck in the international system so what's a lack called an international system it's called a hundred-thousand but then they do give a new name but that's for this number this number that we call 10 lakhs which is basically one followed by six zeros our first seven digit number that one is called a million it's called a million mi ll i o n a million so now you know exactly how big a million is it's exactly equal to ten Lux and so if you were to ask if I were to ask you which is bigger a million or a lakh you would say a million is bigger but not just you know just a little bit bigger but it's ten times bigger so you take ten lakhs and then you get a million and of course then what's a crore so it so happens that now a crore is just 10 times 10 lakhs right in lakhs multiplied by 10 gives you a crore so a million multiplied by 10 will just be 10 million so how big is a crore a crore is in India what we call a crore is 10 times a million so it's bigger than a million by 10 times but then we are done here the Indian system ends with this name everything else is just written in terms of crores like 10 crores hundred crores or a lakh crores or or a crore crores if you want to then what do we do about bigger numbers and these in the International System there are more and more names millions and afterwards there are billions so how big is a billion so now you guess that the billion must be bigger than a crore so let's start writing those numbers down so we're getting into very big numbers here right a crore is an eight digit number one two three four five six seven zeros and a one so eight digits so let's write down our next number to that which is multiplied by 10 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 zeros our first 9 digit number and what would be called as in the Indian system we would call this ten crores then cruise that's the name we'll give to this this number and if I take that number again and if I multiply that by another ten then I get 100 you can see how easily it can become difficult to write these numbers and also count the number of zeros so one two three four five six seven eight nine zeros right and that's a hundred crores right so that's a very big number a hundred crores a hundred crores so in India we call the sten crores and a hundred crores what do we call this internationally so a crore was ten billion so what will ten crores be right you get ten crores by multiplying a crore by ten so in other words 10 million multiplied by ten so ten times ten million what we call a hundred million so ten crores is a hundred million now the next number that we have is a hundred crores this is where there's a new name in the International System so the International System if you can notice keeps giving new names every thousand times so in India ten times thousand multiplied by 100 is a lakh 100 multiple lacs multiplied by 100 is a crore so it's 100 times 100 times but here a thousand multiplied by a thousand is a million and a million multiplied by a thousand is going to be this new word here which is a billion B I ll I oh and a billion so if I have 1 billion rupees that means that I have a hundred crore rupees so is a billion bigger than a crore definitely and not just a little bit bigger it's a hundred times bigger so if you look at it over here you can see that you can start from a thousand and then take it a thousand times and then that becomes a million so million is a thousand times thousand and a billion is a thousand times a million so that's the international system and the Indian system next to each other",

        "transcript": "The base unit for distance in the metric system is the meter. And to get a sense of how long a meter is, the average human being is between 1.5 and 2 meters tall. So 1.5 meters would be a not-so-tall person, but 2 meters would be quite tall. In fact, if you're 2 meters tall or above 2 meters tall, you might want to consider basketball. So, for example, in this drawing right over here by Leonardo da Vinci, if this is an average-sized male, a meter, it would be more than half way across his wingspan. So it might be about that much. And obviously, I am just roughly drawing this, just to give you a sense of how far a meter might be. And I just wrote a lowercase m here as really just a short way of writing meter. So you could imagine that the smaller things you might want to measure with the meter are things like a human being-- a human being's height or a human being's wingspan. If you wanted to say, well, what are some of the larger things that you would want to measure with a meter, you might imagine something like the height of a skyscraper. So this right over here is the Empire State Building, at one time the tallest building in the world, now just a tall building in the world. And this is 443 meters tall. So this is starting to be on the larger scale of things that you would want to measure with a meter. Now you're probably asking, well, what happens if I want to measure things that are even larger than that? Well the metric system provides us prefixes to essentially say multiples of meters. And the unit of distance that is larger than the meter that is most typically used is the kilometer. I've heard a few people say \"kill-O-meter,\" but kilometer, I'll pronounce is \"kuh-LAW-me-ter,\" which is equivalent to 1,000 meters. And so when you're thinking about kilometers, this is thinking about the distance within a city. This would be even the distance from one city to another city. Even the radius of the planet is often measured in kilometers. And to once again get a sense of that, this right over here is a map of New York City. And right over here they give us the scale. This distance right over here is 5 kilometers. So 5 kilometers just to give us a sense of things-- and they wrote km for short so 5 km. This lowercase k, lowercase m is just shorthand for kilometers, this would be equal to-- well if 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, 5 kilometers is going to be 5 times as many. It's going to be 5,000 meters is this distance right over here. If you were to try to imagine 1 kilometer, it would be 1/5 of that. So 1 kilometer on this map might look something like that. Now there's other units in the metric system that allow us to describe distances less than a kilometer but more than a meter. But they're not as typically used. But I'll list them here, just so that you see that they exist. You have the \"hect-O-meter,\" or \"heck-TOM-eter\"-- it's so infrequently used that I really haven't heard a lot of people say it-- which is equal to 100 meters. And you have the \"DECK-a-meter\" or \"deck-AM-eter,\" and I actually think it's \"DECK-a-meter.\" Dekameter, which is 10 meters. And I'm going to write these in orange because they're not that frequently used. For example, it's not typical to hear someone say that the Empire State Building is 4.43 hectometers or for them to say that this is 44.3 dekameters. They would typically say that this is 443 meters. Now you're probably saying, OK, well, this is fine. Using these prefixes on the meter, I'm able to describe distances that are larger than a meter, that are multiples of tens of the meter or a multiple of 100 or a multiple of 1,000 of the meter. But what if I want to go smaller? Well, the metric system has units for that. And if we go just 1/10 of a meter, this is not used as typically, but I'll write it here-- the decimeter. The decimeter is 1/10 of a meter. Or another way of saying it is 1 meter is equal to 10 decimeters, lowercase dm for short. Once again, this is not so typically used. But if we go one scale even below that, we get to the centimeter, which is a heavily used unit. And here, the prefix centi means 1/100. So this is 1/100 of a meter. Another way of thinking about it-- 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters. And if you wanted to imagine the scale of a centimeter, you could imagine this frog right over here on this person's hand might be several centimeters long. So a centimeter on this drawing might be around that distance. Now if you want to measure things even smaller than that, we have another fairly common unit, and that is the millimeter. And the prefix milli here refers to 1/1,000. So it's 1/1,000 of a meter. Or another way of thinking about it is 1 meter is equal to 1,000 millimeter. Actually, let me just write m for short, just so we used to also seeing it that way. 1 meter is equal to 1,000 millimeters. And if you wanted to imagine how long or how far a millimeter is, you could go down the scale of things that are smaller than a centimeter. So these ants, for example, might be 3 or 4 millimeters long. So a millimeter in this drawing right over here might be something like that. The important thing to realize or just to conceptualize is you might want to use different units depending on the scale that you're measuring. And it's also useful to just realize what these typical prefixes refer to because we're seeing it used in distance here. They're all based on the base unit of distance. But when we're measuring volume or we're measuring other things in the metric system, these same prefixes also show up. So you see here when we're measuring distance, kilo refers to 1,000. A kilometer is literally 1,000 meters. Hecto refers to 100. A hectometer-- 100 meters. Deka refers to 10. Deci refers to 1/10. So decimeter, literally 1/10 of a meter. Centimeter-- 1/100, 1/100 of a meter. Milli refers to 1/1,000.",

        "transcript": "Let's think about the units typically used in the metric system to measure an object's weight. And I'm putting the weight in quotation marks right over here because the units I'm going to talk about are-- actually, if we wanted to be technical, they're units of mass. And as we'll see later on in our scientific careers, that weight and mass are not the same thing. They are related. Mass you could view as how much stuff there is. How much substance does an object have? How hard is it to change the velocity of an object? While weight is, what's the force that gravity is pulling down on that object? Now, in everyday life, if we're just on the same planet or the same part of the planet, if something has more mass, it's going to have more weight. And if something has more weight, it's going to have more mass. And that's why in everyday language these words are often interchanged. Later on, we'll see that these mean different things. For the sake of this video, because we're really just getting ourselves warmed up with some of these units, I will use these interchangeably. I'll use them in kind of the everyday language sense, not in the technical physics sense of the word. So in the metric system when people talk about measuring relatively light things, they will often use the gram. And to get a sense of things that weight a gram, one example is a paper clip. Your average size paper clip would weigh about a gram. A stick of chewing gum, not even the whole pack of chewing gum, just a stick of chewing gum, would weigh about a gram. A dollar bill would weigh about a gram. So this really isn't a lot of weight. Now, if you wanted to measure things more on, I would say, a human scale, you could then increase by a factor of thousand and go to the kilogram. Kilogram. And as the unit implies, as the prefix implies I should say, kilo, a thousand. This means 1,000 grams. And if you want to think about how much that represents, well, many people will measure their weight in terms of kilograms. So I, for example, weigh about 70 kilograms. And I'm 5' 9''. And I'm about average build and I weigh about 70 kilograms. If you want to imagine what a kilogram is like, imagine taking a liter of fluid or a liter of water. So if you took a liter of water. And a liter, you could imagine as a 10 centimeter deep cube, 10 centimeters wide, and 10 centimeters high. If you filled this up with water, the weight of that thing is going to be 1 kilogram. I know you're not used to walking around with 1 liter cubes of water. Another way of thinking about it, if you go to the supermarket and you were to buy a 2 liter of soda. And sometimes you buy 2 liters of other things as well-- water, whatever. If you buy a 2 liter of soda is going to weigh-- well, actually, 2 liters of water, in particular, is going to weigh-- soda has other things in it, so you can't be as precise with the weight. But 2 liters of water, I should say, are going to weigh exactly 2 kilograms. We're just talking about the water itself. We're not talking about the container. But if you want to get a rough sense for how much weight that is, that's going to be 2 kilograms. So if you're measuring human scale size things, reasonable size quantities of fluid, objects around this scale, kilogram makes a lot more sense. If you measure these very light things, you're talking about a gram. If you want to get really precise, this might be more in things if you're doing a drug dosage and you need to be very, very, very precise, then you will sometimes see people go to the milligram. But you could imagine a milligram is 1/1,000 of a gram. And so 1/1,000 the weight of a dollar bill or 1/1,000 the weight of a paper clip, this is very, very, very, very small. So this usually doesn't come into play in our everyday life.",

        "transcript": "- [Instructor] Tomas dropped off two packages to be shipped. One package weighed 1.38 kilograms, and the other package weighed 720 grams. So the first one they give in kilograms, and the second one they give us in grams. What was the combined weight of both packages in grams? So what I wanna do is, I'm gonna convert both of these to grams, and then add 'em up to get the combined weight. Well, we already know the second one is 720 grams, but what's the first one in terms of grams? Well, let's see, 1.38, I could write kilograms like that. Well, if one kilogram is 1,000 grams, and that's what the prefix kilo means, it means 1,000, well, to go from one to 1.38, I'm multiplying by 1.38, so I'm also, if I want it in terms of grams, I'll take 1,000 grams and multiply by 1.38. So this is going to be 1,000 times 1.38 is 1,380 grams, which I could've just denoted with a G, but now let's add those together. This is the first package, and then the second package is 720 grams, and so if I were to add, this is going to be, let's see, got a zero, 10, well let's see, four plus seven is 11, and then one plus one is two. We get 2,100 grams in total. Let's do another one of these unit conversion examples. Julia and her friends are making kites out of paper. For each kite, they need a piece of paper that is 0.65 meters wide. How many centimeters, how many centimeters of paper will they need to make four kites? So they tell us how wide the paper is in meters for each kite, but they want the answer in centimeters, and they want it for four kites. So, let's think about this a little bit. Each kite is 0.65 meters, 0.65 meters. So to go from one to 0.65, you'd multiply by 0.65 on the meters, and so to go to 100 centimeters to the number of centimeters you would need for the width of a kite, you'd similarly multiply by 0.65. Well, 65 hundredths times 100 is going to be 65, 65 centimeters per kite. So this 0.65 meters wide per kite, in centimeters it is 65 centimeters. Now, they don't want just how much paper will they need to make one kite, they want four kites. So we would multiply this times four. This is how much we need per kite, so let's multiply that times four. And so let's see, four times five is 20. Four times six is 24, plus two is 26. 260 centimeters of paper for the width of the four kites. Let's do one more of these. This is a volume conversion. Omar is pouring five liters of water into two goldfish bowls. He spills 200 milliliters of water, and then divides the remaining water evenly between the two bowls. How many milliliters of water does Omar pour into each bowl? So we want our answer at the end in milliliters, and so let's just convert the amount that he starts with into milliliters. So he starts with five, he starts with five liters. So how many milliliters is that going to be? Well, they tell us one liter is 1,000 milliliters, so if we have five liters, we're multiplying our quantity times five, that's gonna be five times, it's going to be five times as many milliliters, so that's 1,000 times five is 5,000 milliliters, so that's what he starts with. Now, before he splits this 5,000 milliliters between these two bowls, he spills 200 milliliters, so let's subtract out what he spills, 'cause he, that's not going to be able to be split. Milliliters. And so, that's going to give us, so we're gonna have 4,800 milliliters to split between those two bowls, and so each bowl, that's what they ask us, how many milliliters of water does he pour into each bowl? Well, see, if he's gonna split this into two bowls, each bowl's gonna get half of this, and so each bowl is going to get half of 4,800, so we just divide that by two, so each bowl is going to get 2,400 milliliters, 2,400 milliliters and 2,400 milliliters. That's how much each bowl is going, that's how much Omar is going to pour into each bowl.",

        "transcript": "We've got four numbers here. What I want to do is try to round each of these to the nearest 10 and to the nearest hundred. So I encourage you to pause the video and try that right now. So let's make two columns. Let's make one first for the nearest 10 and then make another column for the nearest 100. And let's start with 154. So 154, what is the multiple of 10 above 154? Well, it's 160. And the multiple of 10 below 154 is 150. So we're going to round up to 160 or down to 150. Well, when we're rounding to the nearest 10, we need to look at the ones place. One place to the right of the place that we're rounding. So we look at this 4 in the ones place. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down to 150. Now, let's think about that same number, rounding to the nearest hundred, so 154 to the nearest hundred. So now we need to think about if we were to round up, what's the multiple of 100 above 154? 160 isn't the multiple of 100 The multiple of 100 above 154 is 200. What's the multiple of 100 below 154? Well, that's going to be 100. So if we're going to round to the nearest hundred-- so we look at the hundreds place. We'll look one place to the right of that, which is the tens place. If that place is 5 or greater, we round up. If it's less than 5, we round down. Well, this is clearly 5 or greater so we round up. So this is interesting. When we rounded to the nearest 10, since we had a 4 in the ones place, we rounded down. But when rounded to the nearest hundreds, since we had a 5 in the tens place, we rounded up to 200. Let's do some more of these. This is fun. So 4,674. The multiple of 10 above that is 4,680. The multiple of 10 below that, 4,670. Remember, we're concerned only with the multiple of 10. So do we round up or down? Well, we're thinking about rounding the tens place. So that's why it's either going to be an 8 if we round up, or a 7 if we round down. To figure that out, we look at the ones place. If the ones place is 5 or greater, we round up. If it's less than 5, we round down. It's, once again, less than 5, so we round down to 4,670. Now let's round the same number to the nearest hundred. What's the multiple of 100 below this? Well, the multiple of 100 below this is 4,600. The multiple of 100 above this is 4,700. If we're trying to think about rounding to the nearest hundred, we want to look at the tens place. The tens place is 5 or greater, so we round up to 4,700. Now let's tackle 9,995. And once again, always try to pause these, if you haven't done so already, to try to do this on your own. So 9,995. What is the multiple of 10 below this. Well the multiples of 10 below this is 9,990. And what's the multiple of 10 above this? Well, if you increase this by 10, you actually get to 10,000. So you might say, hey, well isn't this a multiple of 100, and actually this is a multiple of a thousand-- it's also a multiple of 10,000. It's all of those, but the multiple of 10 right above 9,995 is 10,000. You just have to add a little bit to this to get to 10,000. Or the multiple of 10 below it is clearly 9,990. 10 more than that gets you to 10,000. So how do we around this? Well, once again, if we're rounding to the nearest 10, we want to look at the ones place. The ones place is 5 or greater so we round up to 10,000. Now, let's round to the nearest hundreds. You should be getting used to this now. To the nearest hundreds, what is the hundreds below this? Well, it's 9,900. What is 100 above this, the next multiple of 100 above this? Well, if you add 100 to 9,900 you once again get 10,000. So how do we decide whether to round up or down? Well, we don't look at the ones place anymore. We're now rounding to the nearest hundred. So we want to round to the nearest hundred. To do that, we look one place to the right, which is the tens place. If this is 5 or greater, we round up. If it's less than 5, we round down. It is 5 or greater so once again we round up to 10,000. Now we have one more, 8,346. The multiple of 10 below it is 8,340. Multiple of 10 above that is 8,350. If we're going to round to the nearest 10, we need to look at the ones place. The ones place is 5 or greater, so we round up. Now, let's round to the nearest hundred. 8,346, the multiple of 100 above this is 8,400. The multiple of 100 below this is 8,300. Notice we're rounding to the nearest hundreds. If we were to round up, the hundreds place becomes a 4. If we round down, the hundreds place stays at 3, but it's followed by zeroes. If we want to round to the nearest hundreds, we need to look at the tens place. The tens place here is less than 5, so we round down to 8,300. Notice, again, when we round to the nearest tens, we rounded up to 8,350. When we round to the nearest hundreds, we rounded down to 8,300.",

Now if we wanted the exact number, we could say 42 times 29, and we could work out the multiplication, but they essentially want us to be able to do it in our head. We want to round the numbers first and then multiply. So if we want to round, and really we just have two places here, so if we're going to round anything, it's going to be to the nearest ten because that's the largest place we have. So if we round 42 to the nearest ten-- we've done this drill many times-- 2 in the ones place is the less than 5, so we're going to round down. The nearest ten is 40. We're going to round down to 40. 29, if we round to the nearest ten, 9 in the ones place is greater than or equal to 5, so we round up. The nearest ten is 30. And another way to think about it. Just say, well, you know, 42, that's pretty close to 40. 29 is pretty close to 30. Those are literally the nearest multiples of ten that I can figure out, so now I can multiply. And here, once again, we can use-- you could call it a trick, but hopefully, you understand why it works. But 30 times 40, instead of you saying, well, this is going to be the same thing as 3 times 4, but we're going to put two zeroes at the end of it. 30 times 40 is the same thing as 3 times 4 with two zeroes, so let's do that. So you have 3 times 4 is 12, which we know, and then we have two zeroes. We got that zero, so let's stick that zero there, and then we got that blue zero there, so let's put that over there. So they're going to have roughly $1,200 taken it from sales of the tickets. That is our estimate.",

        "transcript": "- [Instructor] I remember when I was in school, I learnt numbers as one, two, three, and so on, but then when I saw my class board it has class one written on it. You know, first standard, and sometimes we call it STD, so first standard. And then second standard was not written as two, but two I's and, you know, second standard. Third standard was written like this, fourth was written like this, an I and a V, and I did not understand what was going on. So I asked my teacher, \"What are these? \"Why are we writing, \"why aren't we writing just second standard like this?\" And she said, \"Oh, these that you're used to \"they are Hindu Arabic numerals, \"the ones that we usually use, \"but there are other kinds of numerals \"called Roman numerals.\" And that got me really curious and also a little bit confused. I was asking why are there more than one ways to write numbers and if these are Roman numerals, why don't we use them anymore? And of course what are they in the first place? And why should I even learn them? That was main question, so why should I know one more way of writing numbers when I just have one already? And the more I learned about it I realized that it was learning about Roman numerals is sort of like visiting a math museum. If you have gone to a normal or a usual museum you might be used to seeing dinosaurs or their skeletons. I've seen some fossils as well. And this shows that the way the world is today is not the way it always was. We had other ways of doing things which we don't do anymore. And I realized that Roman numerals, or learning Roman numerals, is similar to that. We can go back in time and see how we used to count and even think about questions like why we don't count like that anymore and is what we're doing today better and if so, how? So I learnt more about Roman numeral. I had these alphabets denoting some numbers. Just like in my usual numbers I have one, two, three, four, or what I call, when I say usual I mean the Hindu Arabic numerals. I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. These are my digits and using these I can make every other number possible, so these are the digits of the Hindu Arabic system. Of course, if I also include the pretty important zero to it. So zero to nine make my Hindu Arabic numerals. Similarly, in the Roman system, they had I, V, X, L, C, D, M. Now these weren't really the English alphabets that they used, right? We just picked the English alphabets that looked closest to the symbols that they were using. They were using some symbol that looked like this, like a stick basically, just a vertical stick to denote one and then they had a symbol V for five, X for 10, L for 50, and C for 100. And that's, this is probably enough if you know these and if you're interested then there's D and this L-C-D always sticks out to me. D is for 500 and M is for thousand. Now you can notice that using these we don't yet know how to form, how to read or write Roman numerals. All we now know is that these are the digits that they use. So, in the Hindu Arabic system, maybe I should write Hindu Arabic way out, Hindu Arabic system, how do we write numbers using these. If I want to write 120 then I would take a hundred in my third digit, as my third digit, then put my two 10s and then zero ones. Then I would call this 120. So I'm using the place value system which you're probably familiar with right now, the place value system. The Roman numerals did not have a place value system and they did not even have a specific alphabet for zero. So there is no zero as you can see here. So they were quite a bit different from our Hindu Arabic numerals, but the interesting thing here is to learn how do we read and write in them and it's not really to remember to do that, you probably won't be doing it too often. It's just a fun exercise that we're going to be doing to our own brains.",

        },
        "transcript": "- [Instructor] If I'm a child, and if I wanted to represent one of something, I might just write, hey, one of that. Like one stick or one twig. And then if I wanted two, I might just write two twigs, right, one plus one. Three, three twigs. One next to another. I just write them and say what I have is just one plus one plus one, three. And this is called additive way of writing things. I just add what's there individually because I know this I-like thing stands for one. And then I add I, I, I, three Is, which is just three. So Roman numerals follows this idea of additive representation of numbers. So I'm gonna look at one, and what is one? I'll go here, I'll look at my table. Oh, one, I write one as I. And so it's just I. And then two is, I need two ones, and I just have to write them next to each, so it's II. And three is going to be, that's right, III. Four is going to be IIII. Not really. (chuckles) So it seems right, right, to do this. Write three Is for three, four Is for four. But then it turns out that this is not how we do it, at least not anymore. So I'm gonna put four as controversial. We're gonna talk about four more. So after this, what about five? I'm gonna up here. I can maybe put IIIII. But then, what's going on? It's already becoming hard to read. And we've already made up a new alphabet for five. So I'll be putting five just because that's easier. Now, what should I do for six? It gets interesting for six because how do I write six? So when I look at six, I'll go up here and ask, \"What is the largest thing that I have \"that's smaller than six?\" So six lies between five and 10. So I know that I can write six as five plus something. So I'll first write my five, which is V. And then ask, \"Okay, what is remaining here?\" There's just one remaining. And one, I know how I can write it. I'll just go write the one. And the same thing happens for seven, five plus two. Eight is five plus three. Nine, again, I'm gonna put a question mark here because it's a different way of writing. We do not write VIIII with the four Is. Right, it becomes very long. So I'm gonna put a question mark here. I'm gonna learn how we're gonna write this. And for 10, I'm gonna go up here. It's exactly, I already have an alphabet for it, so I'm just gonna use that. So let's look at an example. If I had 23 with me, and if I want to write 23, how should I think about it? So in my head, I'm going, \"Okay, 23 is more than 10. \"It's less than 50. \"So I should write it as sum times 10, \"and then I'll see what happens.\" So how many 10s are there? And I see that there are two 10s. So I'm gonna write two 10s. Maybe I should use a different color. So two 10s, XX. Is that enough? No, now what I have is 20. So I've taken 23, and I've made it, imagined it to be 20 plus three. 20 plus three. And this 20 has already been written over here. So now what about this three? I treat this as a fresh problem, as if I'm starting all over again. I'll ask, \"Three, where is three between?\" It's between one and five. I already know how to write that, how to write three. So I just go up here and write three as one, two, three. So XXIII will give me 23. And as you can see, if I had been given this number and asked, \"What is this number?\" how would I have read it? I'll have read it by going X is 10, X is 10. So 10 plus 10 is 20. I is one, III is three. So this is 20, this is three. So 20 plus three is 23. So that's exactly the backward process that I would have used. And you can see that in all these cases the bigger number is what we write first and then the smaller numbers. So XX comes and then II. Over here we can see that V comes first and then the I. So whenever we're writing usual numbers it comes in this format, the bigger one first and then the smaller ones. But if you see, in our unique as well. So we said these two are controversial, right. Four and nine. So what is it about four and nine? How do we write four and nine? So instead of thinking of four as four ones where we write IIII. Which in fact, people used to do back in the Roman times, and then they stopped doing it because it just took too much space. And in important documents where there's not much space, we want a shorter way to write four. So what is a shorter way to write four? They thought of four as, \"Hey, I can write it was one less than five.\" So I can put an I, and then I can write a V after that. So this is the first time you're seeing a smaller number come before a larger number. So they said, \"Whenever you see this happening, \"think of it as not one plus five equal to six. \"Don't do that. \"But think of it as five minus one, which is four.\" The same thing goes for nine. Think of it as one minus 10. Actually, 10 minus one, or one less than 10 for nine. So we had an IV for four and IX for nine. And when we do this, this is called the subtractive notation. I'm gonna write it here as subtractive. Now this name is not that important, it's just for you to realize that when we're writing it here in this way, we're actually using a subtraction. Five minus one and 10 minus one. Now, the most important thing to know about this subtractive notation is that it's super rare. It very, very rarely happens. So I'm gonna fill in for four and nine over here. And then let's look at where the subtractive notation is used. So four is IV, and nine is IX. So where is the subtractive notation used? So you can see that it's used very, very, very rarely. In fact, the only special cases are four and nine. You're asking me, \"Don't we use this kind of thing anywhere else?\" We do. But just for the multiples of four and nine. Four and nine, 40, 90, 400, 900. Only for these numbers do you use this subtractive notation. And in fact, you can forget 400 and 900, they're two big numbers. We can just take the four, nine, 40, and 90. So four, you know how to write it, IV. Nine, you'll write it as IX. What about 40 right now? So instead of thinking of 40 as four 10s and writing XXXX, what we do is that we look at 40 as N minus 50. So what must I do then? And I'm again saying 10 minus 50, what I really mean is 50 minus 10. (chuckling softly) I should stop doing this. So 10 less than 50. So 10 less than 50, 50 is L. So I'll write XL. I want you to stop and think about how to do 90. And when you try that, and once you get the answer, look at what I'm doing. So how do you do 90? You will look at this number, 100, and then subtract N from it. So 10 less than 100, that's 90.",

        },
        "transcript": "So if you look at each of these 4 by 6 grids, it's pretty clear that there's 24 of these green circle things in each of them. But what I want to show you is that you can get 24 as the product of three numbers in multiple different ways. And it actually doesn't matter which products you take first or what order you actually do them in. So let's think about this first. So the way that I've colored it in, I have these three groups of 4. If you look at the blue highlighting, this is one group of 4, two groups of 4, three groups of 4. Actually, let me make it a little bit clearer. One group of 4, two groups of 4, and three groups of 4. So these three columns you could view as 3 times 4. Now, we have another 3 times 4 right over here. This is also 3 times 4. We have one group of 4, two groups of 4, and three groups of 4. So you could view these combined as 2 times 3 times 4. We have one 3 times 4. And then we have another 3 times 4. So the whole thing we could view as-- let me give myself some more space-- as 2 times-- let me do that in blue-- 2 times 3 times 4. That's the total number of balls here. And you could see it based on how it was colored. And of course, if you did 3 times 4 first, you get 12. And then you multiply that times 2, you get 24, which is the total number of these green circle things. And I encourage you now to look at these other two. Pause the video and think about what these would be the product of, first looking at the blue grouping, then looking at the purple grouping in the same way that we did right over here, and verify that the product still equals 24. Well, I assume that you've paused the video. So you see here in this first, I guess you could call it a zone, we have two groups of 4. So this is 2 times 4 right over here. We have one group of 4, another group of 4. That's 2 times 4. We have one group of 4, another group of 4. So this is also 2 times 4 if we look in this purple zone. One group of 4, another group of 4. So this is also 2 times 4. So we have three 2 times 4's. So if we look at each of these, or all together, this is 3 times 2 times 4, so 3 times 2 times 4. Notice I did a different order. And here I did 3 times 4 first. Here I'm doing 2 times 4 first. But just like before, 2 times 4 is 8. 8 times 3 is still equal to 24, as it needs to, because we have exactly 24 of these green circle things. Once again, pause the video and try to do the same here. Look at the groupings in blue, then look at the groupings in purple, and try to express these 24 as some kind of product of 2, 3, and 4. Well, you see first we have these groupings of 3. So we have one grouping of 3 in this purple zone, two groupings of 3 in this purple zone. So you could do that as 2 times 3. And we have one 3 and another 3. So in this purple zone, this is another 2 times 3. We have another 2 times 3. Whoops. I wrote 2 times 2. 2 times 3. We have another 2 times 3. And then finally, we have a fourth 2 times 3. So how many 2 times 3's do we have here? Well, we have one, two, three, four 2 times 3's. So this whole thing could be written as 4 times 2 times 3. Now, what's this going to be equal to? Well, it needs to be equal to 24. And we can verify 2 times 3 is 6 times 4 is, indeed, 24. So the whole idea of what I'm trying to show here is that the order in which you multiply does not matter. Let me make this very clear. Let me pick a different example, a completely new example. So let's say that I have 4 times 5 times 6. You can do this multiplication in multiple ways. You could do 4 times 5 first. Or you could do 4 times 5 times 6 first. And you can verify that. I encourage you to pause the video and verify that these two things are equivalent. And this is actually called the associative property. It doesn't matter how you associate these things, which of these that you do first. Also, order does not matter. And we've seen that multiple times. Whether you do this or you do 5 times 4 times 6-- notice I swapped the 5 and 4-- this doesn't matter. Or whether you do this or 6 times 5 times 4, it doesn't matter. Here I swapped the 6 and the 5 times 4. All of these are going to get the exact same value. And I encourage you to pause the video. So when we're talking about which one we do first, whether we do the 4 times 5 first or the 5 times 6, that's called the associative property. It's kind of fancy word for a reasonably simple thing. And when we're saying that order doesn't matter, when it doesn't matter whether we do 4 times 5 or 5 times 4, that's called the commutative property. And once again, fancy word for a very simple thing. It's just saying it doesn't matter what order I do it in.",

Simplify both expressions to show they have identical results. So this associative law of addition, which sounds very fancy and complicated, literally means that you can associate these three numbers in different ways or you can add them in different orders. Now let me just make that clear. So the way they wrote it right here, they wrote it 77 plus 2 in parentheses, and then they wrote plus 3. These parentheses mean do the 77 plus 2 before you add the 3. So if you were to evaluate this, you would evaluate what's in the parentheses first. So you would say, well, 77 plus 2, that's 79, so everything in the parentheses just evaluates to 79.

Now, the associative law of addition tells us it doesn't matter whether we add 77 and 2 first or whether we add 2 and 3 first. We can associate them differently. So this is going to be the exact same thing. This is the exact same thing as-- we could write it this way. Let me write them all. 77 plus 2 plus 3. If we have no parentheses here, this is actually the same thing as this over here, because we'd go 77 plus 2 is 79 plus 3 is 82. But the associative law tells as, well, you know what? I could do 77 plus 2 plus 3. I could add this first and then add it to 77, and it's going to be the exact same thing as if I added these two guys first and then add the 3. Let's verify that for ourselves. So 2 plus 3 is 5, so this evaluates to 77 plus 5. And 77 plus 5, once again, is 82. So it doesn't matter how you associate the numbers. Either way, you get 82.

        "transcript": "We want to figure out how many balloons we have here. And obviously, we could just count these. But now, we have other ways of thinking about it, especially because they're arranged in this nice array, this nice grid pattern here. And the reason why it's useful to not just always have to count it, but to be able to use little multiplication with the number of rows and the number of columns is that you might run into things and you will run into things where it's very hard to count each of the objects individually, but it might be a little bit easier to count the rows and to count the columns. So for example, right over here, we see that we have 1, 2, 3, 4 rows. And we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 columns. So you could view this 4 as an array of objects where we have 4 rows. Let me write that down. We have 4 rows and we have 7 columns. And you might already remember that we can calculate the total number of objects by multiplying the rows times the columns-- 4 rows times 7 columns. Now, why does this work? Why will this give us the actual number of objects? Well, we could view this-- we have 4 rows. So we have 4 groups of things. And how many things are in each of those rows? Well, the number of columns. We have 7 things in each of those 4 rows-- so 4 groups of 7. Or you could view it the other way around. You could view that each column is a group. So then you have 7 groups. And how many objects do you have in each? Well, that's what the rows tell you. You have 4 things in each of those columns. And we already know that both of these quantities are going to find the exact same number, the number of things that we have right over here. So these two things are equivalent. 4 times 7 is equal to 7 times 4. And there's a bunch of ways that we can calculate either one of these. We can skip count by 4. We say 4 times 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28. And let's see. Let me make sure that that's 7. So 4 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- so we get 28. We could just calculate that there are 28 objects here. And likewise, we could skip count by 7. So we could go 7-- 7 times 2 is 14, times 3 is 21, times 4 is 28, just adding seven every time. And so we could get 28 the other way. Let's do that in that same color. We could get 28 the other way. But if you had a situation where you didn't know-- where you either didn't want to do these techniques or it had been hard to do these techniques or you didn't know what 4 times 7 was off the top of your head, which you should know at some point in the very, very near future. Is there any way to break this down to something that maybe you do know or maybe that's a little bit easier to compute? Well, you could realize that 7 columns is the same thing as 5 columns and then 2 columns. So you could view 7 columns as 5 columns-- so this is 5 columns right over here-- plus 2 columns. So that's just like saying that 4 times 7 is the same thing as 4 times 5 plus 2. And all I do is I replace the seven with a 5 plus 2. 7 has been replaced with a 5 plus 2. Now, why is this interesting? Well, now, I can break this up into two separate arrays. So I could say, well, look, there's the array that has 4 rows and 2 columns right over here. And then there's the array that has 4 rows and 5 columns right over here. So how many objects are in this one, in the yellow one right over here? Well, there's 4 times 5 objects. So there's 4 times 5 objects in the yellow grid or yellow array. And how many in this orange-ish looking thing? Well, there's going to be 4 times 2. And if we take the sum of the 4 times the 5 and the 4 times the 2, what are we going to get? Well, we're going to get the 4 times the 7. We're going to get the 4 times the 5 plus 2. So if we take sum of these things-- and we want to do the multiplication first, so I'll just put a parentheses around that to emphasize that-- this is going to be the same thing as these things up here. And so you might say, oh, well, I know what 4 times 5 is. 4 times 5 is 20. 4 times 2 is 8. 20 plus 8 is 28. And you might say, OK, Sal, I get it. 4 times 7 is 28, which is the same thing as 4 times 5 plus 2. And I see that that's the same thing as 4 times 5 plus 4 times 2. And actually, this is called the distributive property-- that 4 times 5 plus 2 is the same thing as 4 times 5 plus 4 times 2. But I could just do one of these first techniques you talked about. Why is this distributive property that you just showed me useful for computing or doing multiplication problems? Well, let me give you a slightly more difficult one. Let's imagine you wanted to multiply 6 times 36. Actually, I don't need to write that parentheses. So how could you do this? Well, you could decompose 36 into two products or into two numbers where it's easier to find the product of that and 6. So for example 36, is the same thing as 30 plus 6. So this is going to be equal to 6 times 30 plus 6. And what's this going to be? Well, we just saw. 6 times these two things added together first, this is going to be equal to 6 times 30 plus 6 times 6. Notice, we distributed the 6-- 6 times 30 plus 6 times 6. Now, why is this useful? Why was this useful at all? I'm going to put parentheses to emphasize. We're going to do the multiplication first. In general, when you see multiplication and addition in a row like this, or division, you want to do your multiplication and division first, then do your addition and subtraction. So what's 6 times 30? Well, this is easier to calculate. 6 times 3, we know to be 18. So 6 times 30 is going to be 180. And 6 times 6-- well, we know that's going to be 36. So this is going to be 180 plus 36. And what's that going to be? 180 plus 36-- well, 0 plus 6 is 6. 8 plus 3 is 11. 1 plus 1 is 2. So you just figured out that 6 times 36 is equal to 216. And what we just did with the distributive property, this is actually going to be how you're going to multiply all sorts of larger numbers, way larger than what we just saw. So the distributive property, which hopefully you're pretty convinced by, based on how we broke things up, is a super useful thing as you want to compute larger and larger numbers. And you're going to find it even more useful when you go even further in your mathematical career.",

But we're to the left of zero (we've been moving to the left) so it's the <i>negative</i> of that which is -10 So if your signs are the same, you can just take the absolute value of them say \"ok, that's how far we're going to move, total. and we're that far from zero to the left\" So the answer here is -10 That was when y is -3. Let's think about when y is equal to 0. When y is equal to 0, this expression up here becomes 0 plus 0 (our y here is going to be zero)... (We'll do it in that same blue color.) .... plus 0 plus -7. Now, if you add 0 to anything it's not going to change the value. So this thing over here, this is pretty straight-forward, these don't matter It's just going to be equal to -7 Now let's do the last one (when y is equal to 7) It's going to be 0 plus (our y is equal to 7) so 0 plus 7 and then we have plus -7 Now there's a couple of ways to do this... You could literally just say \"now adding a negative number is equivalent to subtracting the number\". You could say this is equivalent to 0 plus 7 minus 7 Plus -7 is the same thing as subtracting a 7 The zero doesn't matter, so this is equal to 7 minus 7... which is equal to zero! Another way to think about it... Let's draw a number line So let's say that this is zero We're starting off at 7. We're 7 to the right of zero. And to that we're adding a -7. So we're going to move 7 to the left of where we were. 7 to the left of 7 which was 7 to the right of 0! This gets us back to 0. So the answer is... zero.",

        },
        "transcript": "Find all of the factors of 120. Or another way to think about it, find all of the whole numbers that 120 is divisible by. So the first one, that's maybe obvious. All whole numbers are divisible by 1. So we could write 120 is equal to is to 1 times 120. So let's write a factors list over here. So this is going to be our factors list over here. So we just found two factors. We said, well, is it divisible by 1? Well, every whole number is divisible by 1. This is a whole number, so 1 is a factor at the low end. 1 is a factor. That's its actual smallest factor, and its largest factor is 120. You can't have something larger than 120 dividing evenly into 120. 121 will not go into 120. So the largest factor on our factors list is going to be 120. Now let's think about others. Let's think about whether is 2 divisible into 120? So there's 120 equals 2 times something? Well, when you look here, maybe you immediately recognize that 120 is an even number. It's ones place is a 0. As as long as its ones place is a 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, as long as it's an even number, the whole number is even and the whole number is divisible by 2. And to figure out what you have to multiply by 2 to get 120, well, you can think of 120 as 12 times 10, or another way to think about it, it's 2 times 6 times 10, or 2 times 60. You could divide it out if you want. You could say, OK, 2 goes into 120. 2 goes into 1 no times. 2 goes into 12 six times. 6 times 2 is 12. Subtract. You get 0. Bring down the 0. 2 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 2 is 0, and you get no remainder there, so it goes sixty times. So we have two more factors right here. So we have the factors. So we've established the next lowest one is 2, and the next highest factor, if we're starting from the large end, is going to be 60. Now let's think about three. Is 120 equal to 3 times something? Well, we could just try to test and divide it from the get go, but hopefully, you already know the divisibility rule. To figure out if something is divisible by 3, you add up its digits, and if the sum is divisible by 3, we're in business. So if you take 120-- let me do it over here. 1 plus 2 plus 0, well, that's equal to 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 0 is 3, and 3 is definitely divisible by 3. So 120 is going to be divisible by 3. To figure what that number that you have to multiply by 3 is, you could do it in your head. You could say, well, 3 goes into 12 four times, and then you-- well, let me just do it out, just in case, just for those of you who want to see it worked out. 3 goes into 12 four times. 4 times 3 is 12. You subtract. You're left with nothing here. You bring down this 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 3 is 0. Nothing left over. So it goes into it forty times. And the way to think of it in your head is this is the same thing as 12 times 10. 12 divided by 3 is 4, but this is going to be 4 times 10, because you have that 10 left over. Whatever works for you. Or you can just ignore the 0, divide by 3, you get a 4, and then put the 0 back there. Whatever works. So we have two more factors. At the low end, we have 3, and at the high end, we have a 40. Now, let's see if 4 divisible into 120. Now we saw the divisibility rule for 4 is you ignore everything beyond the tens places and you just look at the last two digits. So if we're going to to think about whether 4 is divisible, you just look at the last two digits. The last two digits are 20. 20 is definitely divisible by 4, so 120 will be divisible by 4. 4 is going to be a factor. And to figure out what we have to multiply 4 by to get 120, you could do it in your head. You could say 12 divided by 4 is 3, so 120 divided by 4 is 30. So we have two more factors: 4 and 30. And you could work this out in long division if you want to make sure that this works out, so let's keep going. And then we have 120 is equal to-- is 5 a factor? Is 5 times something equal to 120? Well, you can't do that simple-- well, first of all, we could just test is it divisible? And 120 ends with a 0. If you end with a 0 or a 5, you are divisible by 5. So 5 definitely goes into it. Let's figure out how many times. So 5 goes into 120. It doesn't go into 1. It goes into 12 two times. 2 times 5 is 10. Subtract. You get 2. Bring down the 0. 5 goes into 20 four times. 4 times 5 is 20, and then you subtract, and you have no left over, as we expect, because it should go in evenly. This number ends with a 0 or a 5. Let me delete all of this so we can have our scratch space to work with later on. So 5 times 24 is also equal to 120, we have two more factors: 5 and 24. Let me clear up some space here because I think we're going to be dealing with a lot of factors. So let me move this right here. Let me cut it and then let me paste it and move this over here so we have more space for our factors. So we have 5 and 24. Let's move on to 6. So 120 is equal to 6 times what? Now, to be divisible by 6, you have to be divisible by 2 and 3. Now, we know that we're already divisible by 2 and 3, so we're definitely going to be divisible by 6, and you should hopefully be able to do this one in your head. 5 was a little bit harder to do in your head. but 120, you could say, well, 12 divided by 6 is 2, and then you have that 0 there, so 120 divided by 6 would be 20. And you could work it out in long division if you like. So 6 times 20 are two more factors. Now let's think about 7. Let's think about 7 here. 7 is a very bizarre number, and just to test it, you could think of other ways to do it. Let's just try to divide 7 into 120. 7 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 12 one time. 1 times 7 is 7. You subtract. 12 minus 7 is 5. Bring down the 0. 7 times 7 is 49, so it goes into it seven times. 7 times 7 is 49. Subtract. You have a remainder, so it does not divide evenly. So 7 does not work. Now let's think about 8. Let's think about whether 8 works. Let's think about 8. I'll do the same process. Let's take 8 into 120. Let's just work it out. And just as a little bit of a hint-- well, I'll just work it out. 8 goes into 12-- it doesn't go into 1, so it goes into 12 one time. 1 times 8 is 8. Subtract there. 12 minus 8 is 4. Bring down the 0. 8 goes into 40 five times. 5 times 8 is 40, and you're left with no remainder, so it goes evenly. So 120-- let me get rid of that. 120 is equal to 8 times 15, so let's add that to our factor list. We now have an 8 and now we have a 15. Now, is it divisible by 9? Is 120 divisible by 9? To test that out, you just add up the digits. 1 plus 2 plus 0 is equal to 3. Well, that'll satisfy our 3 divisibility rule, but 3 is not divisible by 9, so our number will not be divisible by 9. So 9 will not work out. 9 does not work out. So let's move on to 10. Well, this is pretty straightforward. It ends in 0, so we will be divisible by 10. So let me write that down. 120 is equal to 10 times-- and this is pretty straightforward-- 10 times 12. This is exactly what 120 is. It's 10 times 12, so let's write those factors down. 10 and 12. And then we have one number left. We have 11. We don't have to go above 11, because we already went through 12, and we know that there aren't any factors above that, because we were going in descending order, so we've really filled in all the gaps. You could try 11. We could try it by hand, if you like. 11 goes into 120-- now you know, if with you know your multiplication tables through 11, that this won't work, but I'll just show you. 11 goes into 12 one time. 1 times 11 is 11. Subtract. 1, bring down the 0. 11 goes into 10 zero times. 0 times 11 is 0. you're left with a remainder of 10. So 11 goes into 20 ten times with a remainder of 10. It definitely does not go in evenly. So we have all of our factors here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60 and 120. And we're done!",

Or another way of thinking about it-- a number is a factor of 154 if 154 is a multiple of that number. So let's look at each of these and see which of these we can rule out or say is a factor. So does 3 divide evenly into 154? Or, another way of thinking about it, is 154 a multiple of 3? Well you'll later learn that you could actually test whether something is divisible by 3 by adding up the digits. And if that's divisible by 3, then it's going to be divisible by 3. And so you see here, 1 plus 5 is 6. 6 plus 4 is 10. 10 is not divisible by 3. But if you didn't want to do that little trick-- and we have other videos where we go into more detail about that trick-- you can actually just divide 3 into 154. 3 doesn't go into 1. It does go into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15. Subtract. Then we have 0. Then you bring down a 4. 3 goes into 4 one time. 1 times 3 is 3. Subtract, and you have a remainder of 1. So 3 is clearly not a factor of 154, so we can rule that out. Now what about 5? Well, any multiple of 5 is either going to have 5 or 0 in the ones place. You see that if we write 5 times 1 is 5, 5 times 2 is 10, 5 times 3 is 15, 5 times 4 is 20, you either have a 5 or a 0 in the ones place. This does not have 5 or a 0 the ones place, so it's not going to be divisible by 5. 5 is not a factor. 154 is not a multiple of 5. Now 6 is interesting. You could do the same thing. You could try to divide 6 into 154. But if something is divisible by 6, it's definitely going to be divisible by 3 as well because 6 is divisible by 3. So we can immediately rule this one out as well. Because 154 is not divisible by 3, it's also not going to be divisible by 6. And you could try it out if you like. And we could make the same argument for 9. If something is divisible by 9, it's going to be divisible by 3 because 9 is divisible by 3. Well, it's not divisible by 3, so we're going to rule out 9 as well. So we've ruled out everything. It looks like 14 is our only option, but let's actually verify it. Let's actually divide 14 into 154. 14 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 15 exactly one time. 1 times 14 is 14. We subtract. We get 1. Bring down the 4. 14 goes into 14 one time. 1 times 14 is 14. And of course, we have no remainder. So 14 goes into 154 exactly 11 times. Or 11 times 14 is 154. 154 is a multiple of 14. Let's do one more. Which of the following numbers is a multiple of 14? So now we have 14, and we're trying to think of its multiples. So there's two ways of doing this. You could go number by number and try to divide 14 into them, or we could just try to figure out what all of the multiples of 14 actually are. So let's try to do that. Let's try to do that second technique. 14 times 1 is 14. You add another 14. 14 times 2 is 28. Add another 14. Let's see, you add 10. You get to 38. Then you add 4 more. You get to 42. Then you add another 14. I haven't seen any of these numbers show up yet. Add another 14 to this. You get to 56-- still not quite there. Add another 14. Let's see, if you add 4, you get to 60, and you have to add the 10. So then you get to 70. And it looks like we have found one of these numbers. 70 is a multiple of 14. 14 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- 14 times 5 is 70.",

        },
        "transcript": "In this video, I want to talk a little bit about what it means to be a prime number. And what you'll see in this video, or you'll hopefully see in this video, is it's a pretty straightforward concept. But as you progress through your mathematical careers, you'll see that there's actually fairly sophisticated concepts that can be built on top of the idea of a prime number. And that includes the idea of cryptography. And maybe some of the encryption that your computer uses right now could be based on prime numbers. If you don't know what encryption means, you don't have to worry about it right now. You just need to know the prime numbers are pretty important. So I'll give you a definition. And the definition might be a little confusing, but when we see it with examples, it should hopefully be pretty straightforward. So a number is prime if it is a natural number-- and a natural number, once again, just as an example, these are like the numbers 1, 2, 3, so essentially the counting numbers starting at 1, or you could say the positive integers. It is a natural number divisible by exactly two numbers, or two other natural numbers. Actually I shouldn't say two other, I should say two natural numbers. So it's not two other natural numbers-- divisible by exactly two natural numbers. One of those numbers is itself, and the other one is one. Those are the two numbers that it is divisible by. And that's why I didn't want to say exactly two other natural numbers, because one of the numbers is itself. And if this doesn't make sense for you, let's just do some examples here, and let's figure out if some numbers are prime or not. So let's start with the smallest natural number-- the number 1. So you might say, look, 1 is divisible by 1 and it is divisible by itself. You might say, hey, 1 is a prime number. But remember, part of our definition-- it needs to be divisible by exactly two natural numbers. 1 is divisible by only one natural number-- only by 1. So 1, although it might be a little counter intuitive is not prime. Let's move on to 2. So 2 is divisible by 1 and by 2 and not by any other natural numbers. So it seems to meet our constraint. It's divisible by exactly two natural numbers-- itself, that's 2 right there, and 1. So 2 is prime. And I'll circle the prime numbers. I'll circle them. Well actually, let me do it in a different color, since I already used that color for the-- I'll just circle them. I'll circle the numbers that are prime. And 2 is interesting because it is the only even number that is prime. If you think about it, any other even number is also going to be divisible by 2, above and beyond 1 and itself. So it won't be prime. We'll think about that more in future videos. Let's try out 3. Well, 3 is definitely divisible by 1 and 3. And it's really not divisible by anything in between. It's not divisible by 2, so 3 is also a prime number. Let's try 4. I'll switch to another color here. Let's try 4. Well, 4 is definitely divisible by 1 and 4. But it's also divisible by 2. 2 times 2 is 4. It's also divisible by 2. So it's divisible by three natural numbers-- 1, 2, and 4. So it does not meet our constraints for being prime. Let's try out 5. So 5 is definitely divisible by 1. It's not divisible by 2. It's not divisible by 3. It's not exactly divisible by 4. You could divide them into it, but you would get a remainder. But it is exactly divisible by 5, obviously. So once again, it's divisible by exactly two natural numbers-- 1 and 5. So, once again, 5 is prime. Let's keep going, just so that we see if there's any kind of a pattern here. And then maybe I'll try a really hard one that tends to trip people up. So let's try the number. 6. It is divisible by 1. It is divisible by 2. It is divisible by 3. Not 4 or 5, but it is divisible by 6. So it has four natural number factors. I guess you could say it that way. And so it does not have exactly two numbers that it is divisible by. It has four, so it is not prime. Let's move on to 7. 7 is divisible by 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6. But it's also divisible by 7. So 7 is prime. I think you get the general idea here. How many natural numbers-- numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the numbers that you learned when you were two years old, not including 0, not including negative numbers, not including fractions and irrational numbers and decimals and all the rest, just regular counting positive numbers. If you have only two of them, if you're only divisible by yourself and one, then you are prime. And the way I think about it-- if we don't think about the special case of 1, prime numbers are kind of these building blocks of numbers. You can't break them down anymore they're almost like the atoms-- if you think about what an atom is, or what people thought atoms were when they first-- they thought it was kind of the thing that you couldn't divide anymore. We now know that you could divide atoms and, actually, if you do, you might create a nuclear explosion. But it's the same idea behind prime numbers. In theory-- and in prime numbers, it's not theory, we know you can't break them down into products of smaller natural numbers. Things like 6-- you could say, hey, 6 is 2 times 3. You can break it down. And notice we can break it down as a product of prime numbers. We've kind of broken it down into its parts. 7, you can't break it down anymore. All you can say is that 7 is equal to 1 times 7, and in that case, you really haven't broken it down much. You just have the 7 there again. 6 you can actually break it down. 4 you can actually break it down as 2 times 2. Now with that out of the way, let's think about some larger numbers, and think about whether those larger numbers are prime. So let's try 16. So clearly, any number is divisible by 1 and itself. Any number, any natural number you put up here is going to be divisible by 1 and 16. So you're always going to start with 2. So if you can find anything else that goes into this, then you know you're not prime. And 16, you could have 2 times 8, you could have 4 times 4. So it's got a ton of factors here above and beyond just the 1 and 16. So 16 is not prime. What about 17? 1 and 17 will definitely go into 17. 2 doesn't go into 17. 3 doesn't go. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11-- none of those numbers, nothing between 1 and 17 goes into 17. So 17 is prime. And now I'll give you a hard one. This one can trick a lot of people. What about 51? Is 51 prime? And if you're interested, maybe you could pause the video here and try to figure out for yourself if 51 is a prime number. If you can find anything other than 1 or 51 that is divisible into 51. It seems like, wow, this is kind of a strange number. You might be tempted to think it's prime. But I'm now going to give you the answer-- it is not prime, because it is also divisible by 3 and 17. 3 times 17 is 51. So hopefully that gives you a good idea of what prime numbers are all about. And hopefully we can give you some practice on that in future videos or maybe some of our exercises.",

When the \"a\" part, or real part, of \"s\" is equal to 1/2, there arises a common problem in number theory, called the Riemann Hypothesis, which says that all of the non-trivial zeroes of the function lie on that real line 1/2. The distribution of the values directly relate to the amount of primes that there are beneath the value \"n\" in the function. This delves into complex analysis, in which there are graphs with four dimensions, where the fourth dimension is represented by the darkness of the color of the 3-D graph at its separate values.

        "transcript": "Determine whether the following numbers are prime, composite, or neither. So just as a bit of review, a prime number is a natural number-- so one of the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so on and so forth-- that has exactly two factors. So its factors are 1 and itself. So an example of a prime factor is 3. There's only two natural numbers that are divisible into 3-- 1 and 3. Or another way to think about it is, the only way to get 3 as a product of other natural numbers is 1 times 3. So it only has 1 and itself. A composite number is a natural number that has more than just 1 and itself as factors. And we'll see examples of that and neither-- we'll see an interesting case of that in this problem. So first let's think about 24. So let's think about all of the-- I guess you could think of it as the natural numbers or the whole numbers, although 0 is also included in whole numbers. Let's think of all of the natural counting numbers that we can actually divide into 24 without having any remainder. We'd consider those the factors. Well, clearly it is divisible by 1 and 24. In fact, 1 times 24 is equal to 24. But it's also divisible by 2. 2 times 12 is 24. So it's also divisible by 12. And it is also divisible by 3. 3 times 8 is also equal to 24. And even at this point, we don't actually have to find all of the factors to realize that it's not prime. It clearly has more factors than just 1 and itself. So then it is clearly going to be composite. This is going to be composite. Now, let's just finish factoring it just since we started it. It's also divisible by 4. And 4 times 6-- had just enough space to do that. 4 times 6 is also 24. So these are all of the factors of 24, clearly more than just one and 24. Now let's think about 2. Well, the non-zero whole numbers that are divisible into 2, well, 1 times 2 definitely works, 1 and 2. But there really aren't any others that are divisible into 2. And so it only has two factors, 1 and itself, and that's the definition of a prime number. So 2 is prime. And 2 is interesting because it is the only even prime number. And that might be common sense you. Because by definition, an even number is divisible by 2. So 2 is clearly divisible by 2. That's what makes it even. But it's only divisible by 2 and 1. So that's what makes it prime. But anything else that's even is going to be divisible by 1, itself, and 2. Any other number that is even is going to be divisible by 1, itself, and 2. So by definition, it's going to have 1 and itself and something else. So it's going to be composite. So 2 is prime. Every other even number other than 2 is composite. Now, here is an interesting case. 1-- 1 is only divisible by 1. So it is not prime, technically, because it only has 1 as a factor. It does not have two factors. 1 is itself. But in order to be prime, you have to have exactly two factors. 1 has only one factor. In order to be composite, you have to have more than two factors. You have to have 1, yourself, and some other things. So it's not composite. So 1 is neither prime nor composite. And then finally we get to 17. 17 Is divisible by 1 and 17. It's not divisible by 2, not divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6. 7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16. So it has exactly two factors-- 1 and itself. So 17 is once again-- 17 is prime.",

        "transcript": "What we're going to do in this video are some real quick tests to see if these three random numbers are divisible by any of these numbers here. And I'm not going to focus a lot on the why of why they're divisible-- we'll do that in other videos-- but really just to give you a sense of how do you actually test to see if this is divisible by 2 or 5 or 9 or 10. So let's get started. So to test whether any of these are divisible by 2, you really just have to look at the ones place and see if the ones place is divisible by 2. And right over here, 8 is divisible by 2, so this thing is going to be divisible by 2. 0 is considered to be divisible by 2, so this is going to be divisible by 2. Another way to think about it is if you have an even number over here-- and 0 is considered to be an even number-- then you're going to be divisible by 2. And over here, you do not have a number that is divisible by 2. This is not an even number, this 5, so this is not divisible by 2. So I won't write any 2 there. So we've gone through the 2s. Now, let's work through the 3s. So to figure out if you're divisible by 3, you really just have to add up all the digits and figure out if the sum is divisible by 3. So let's do that. So if I do 2 plus 7 plus 9 plus 9 plus 5 plus 8 plus 8, what's this going to be equal to? 2 plus 7 is 9. 9 plus 9 is 18, plus 9 is 27, plus 5 is 32, plus 8 is 40, plus 8 is 48. And 48 is divisible by 3. But in case you're not sure-- so this is equal to 48-- in case you're not sure whether it's divisible by 3, you can just add these digits up again. So 4 plus 8 is equal to 12, and 12 clearly is divisible by 3. And if you're not even sure there, you could add those two digits up. 1 plus 2 is equal to 3, and so this is divisible by 3. This right over here, let's add up the digits. And we can do this one in our head pretty easily. 5 plus 6 is 11. 11 plus 7 is 18. 18 plus 0 is 18. And if you want to add the 1 plus 8 on the 18, you get 9. So the digits add up to 9. So these add up to 9. Well, they add to 18, which is clearly divisible by 3 and by 9, and these two things will add to 9. So the important thing to know is when you add up all the digits, the sum is divisible by 3. So this is divisible by 3 as well, divisible by 3. And then finally, Let's add up these digits. 1 plus 0 plus 0 plus 7 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 5 is 19. So we summed up the digits. 19 is not divisible by 3. So this one, we're not going to write a 3 right over there. It's not divisible by 3. Let's try 4. And to think about 4, you just have to look at the last two digits and to see-- are the last two digits divisible? Are the last two digits divisible by 4? Immediately, you can look at this one right over here, see it's an odd number. If it's not going to be divisible by 2, it's definitely not going to be divisible by 4. So this one's not divisible by any of the first few numbers right over here. But let's think about one, 88. Is that divisible by 4? And you can do that in your head. That's 4 times 22. So this is divisible by 4. Now, let's see. 4 goes into 60 15 times. And then to go from 60 to 70, you have to get another 10, which is not divisible by 4. So that's not divisible by 4. And you can even try to divide it out yourself. 4 goes into 70, let's see, one time. You subtract, you get a 30. 4 goes into 30 seven times. You multiply, then you subtract. You get a 2 right over here as your remainder, so it is not divisible by 4. Now, let's move on to 5. Now, you're probably already very familiar with this. If your final digit is a 5 or a 0, you are divisible by 5. So this one is not divisible by 5. This one is divisible by 5. You have a 0 there, so this is divisible by 5. And this, you have a 5 as your ones digit. So once again-- finally-- this is divisible by something. It's divisible by 5. Now, the number 6. The simple way to think about divisibility by 6 is that you have to be divisible by both 2 and 3 in order to be divisible by 6, because the prime factorization of 6 is 2 times 3. So here, we're divisible by 2 and 3, so we're going to be divisible by-- let me do that in a new color-- so we're going to be divisible by 6. Here, we're divisible by 2 and 3, so we're going to be divisible by 6. And if you were just divisible by 2 or 3, just one of them, then you wouldn't be able to do this. You have to have both a 2 and a 3, divisibility by both of them. And here, you're divisible by neither 2 nor 3, so you're not going to be divisible by 6. Now, let's do the test for 9. The test for 9 is very similar to the test for 3. Sum up all the digits. If that sum is divisible by 9, then you're there. Well, we already summed up the digits here, 48. 48 actually is not divisible by 9. If you're not sure, you can add up the digits there. You get 12. 12 is definitely not divisible by 9. So this thing right over here is not divisible by 9. And this one over here, if you added up all the digits, we got 18, which is divisible. It is divisible by 9. And I'm running out of colors. So this one is divisible by 9. All the digits added up to 18. And this one over here, you don't even have to add them up, because we already know it's not divisible by 3. If it's not divisible by 3, it can't be divisible by 9. But if you did add up the digits, you get 19, which is not divisible by 9. So this also is not divisible by 9. And then finally, divisibility by 10. And this is the easiest one of all, because you just have to see if you have a 0 in the ones place. You clearly do not have a 0 in the ones place here. You do have a 0 in the ones place there, so you are divisible by 10 here. And then finally, you don't have a 0 in the ones place here, so you're not going to be divisible by 10. Another way you could think about it, you have to be divisible by both 2 and 5 to be divisible by 10. Here, you are divisible by 5 but not by 2. But obviously, the easiest one is to just see if you have a 0 in the ones place.",

                "a": "Actually, divisibility by 7 & 8 is quite easy once you get the hang of it.\n\nFirst, I will talk about divisibility by 8, since it is easier. In order to test this, you only must check to see whether the last three digits of the number are divisible by 8. If they are, then the entire number is divisible by 8 too.\n\nExample 1: Is the number 8347475537272 divisible by 8?\nAnswer 1: Yes, because the last 3 digits, 272, are divisible by 8.\n\nExample 2: Is the number 314159265358979323846 divisible by 8?\nAnswer 2: No, because the last 3 digits, 846, are not divisible by 8.\n\n\nNext, divisibility by 7. This one is a little weird but it really is quite simple after you practice it a couple of times. In order to test this, you must take the last digit of the number you\u2019re testing and double it. Then, subtract this number from the rest of the remaining digits. If this new number is either 0 or if it\u2019s a number that\u2019s divisible by 7, then then original number is divisible by seven. (You may have to repeat this a couple of times if the divisibility of the resulting number is not immediately obvious).\n\nExample 1: Is the number 364 divisible by 7?\nAnswer 1: Yes: Double the 4 to get 8. Subtract 8 from 36 to get 28. Since 28 is divisible by 7, we can now say for certain that 364 is also divisible by 7.\n\nExample 2: Is the number 8256 divisible by 7?\nAnswer 2: No, Double 6 to get 12. Subtract 12 from 825 to get 813. 813 is slightly too large to tell whether it is divisible by 7 so we must repeat the process. Double 3 to get 6. Subtract 6 from 81 to get 75. Since 75 is not divisible by 7, neither is 813 or 8256. Therefore, 8256 is not divisible by 7.\n\nIf I wasn't clear with my explanation or if you need any more help, just ask. I hope that helped. :)\n\n\nP.S. This edit was made in response to a.ortalda's great question about divisibility by 7. It is as follows:\n\nWhat about the number used in this video? I tried to test the divisibility by 7 of 2799588, but at a certain point I have 27994 - (2*2) = 27990. How can I continue?\n\nFor this special case, you can just drop the zero from 27990 to 2799 and continue from there. This works because, in essence, you are dividing by 10. Since 10 equals 5*2 (neither of which are 7), it should not influence the result.\n\nTo finish the problem, 279 - 9*2 = 261. 26 - 1*2 = 24. Since 24 is not divisible by 7, neither is 2799588."

        },
        "transcript": "Determine whether 380 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10. They skipped 7 and 8 so we don't have to worry about those. So let's think about 2. So are we divisible by 2? Let me write the 2 here. Well, in order for something to be divisible by 2, it has to be an even number, and to be an even number, your ones digit-- so let me rewrite 380. To be even, your ones digit has to be even, so this has to be even. And for this to be even, it has to be 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, and this is 0, so 380 is even, which means it is divisible by 2, so it works with 2. So 2 works out. Let's think about the situation for 3. Now, a quick way to think about 3-- so let me write just 3 question mark-- is to add the digits of your number. And if the sum that you get is divisible by 3, then you are divisible by 3. So let's try to do that. So 380, let's add the digits. 3 plus 8 plus 0 is equal to-- 3 plus 8 is 11 plus 0, so it's just 11. And if you have trouble figuring out whether this is divisible by 3, you could then just add these two numbers again, so you can actually add the 1 plus 1 again, and you would get a 2. Regardless of whether you look at the 1 or the 2, neither of these are divisible by 3. So not divisible by 3, and maybe in a future video, I'll explain why this works, and maybe you want to think about why this works. So these aren't divisible by 3, so 380 is not divisible. 380, not divisible by 3, so 3 does not work. We are not divisible by 3. Now, I'll think about the situation for 4, so we're thinking about 4 divisibility. So let me write it in orange. So we are wondering about 4. Now, something you may or may not already realize is that 100 is divisible by 4. It goes evenly. So this is 380. So the 300 is divisible by 4, so we just have to figure out whether the leftover, whether the 80, is divisible by 4. Another way to think about it is are the last two digits divisible by 4? And this comes from the fact that 100 is divisible by 4, so everything, the hundreds place or above, it's going to be divisible by 4. You just have to worry about the last part. So in this situation, is 80 divisible by 4? Now, you could eyeball that. You could say, well, 8 is definitely divisible by 4. 8 divided by 4 is 2. 80 divided by 4 is 20, so this works. Yes! Yes! So since 80 is divisible by 4, 380 is also divisible by 4, so 4 works. So let's do 5. I'll actually scroll down a little bit. Let's try 5. So what's the pattern when something is divisible by 5? Let's do the multiple of 5? 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. So if something's divisible by 5-- I could keep going-- that means it ends with either a 5 or a 0, right? Every multiple of 5 either has a 5 or a 0 in the ones place. Now 380 has a 0 in the ones place, so it is divisible by 5. Now, let's think about the situation for 6. Let's think about what happens with 6. So we want to know are we divisible by 6? So to be divisible by 6, you have to be divisible by the things that make up 6. Remember, 6 is equal to 2 times 3. So if you're divisible by 6, that means you are divisible by 2 and you are divisible by 3. If you're divisible by both 2 and 3, you'll be divisible by 6. Now, 380 is divisible by 2, but we've already established that it is not divisible by 3. If it's not divisible by 3, it cannot be divisible by 6, so this gets knocked out. We are not divisible by 6. Now, let's go to 9. So divisibility by 9. So you can make a similar argument here that if something is not divisible by 3, there's no way it's going to be divisible by 9 because 9 is equal to 3 times 3. So to be divisible by 9, you have to be divisible by 3 at least twice. At least two 3's have to go into your number, and this isn't the case, so you could already knock 9 out. But if we didn't already know that we're not divisible by 3, the other way to do it is a very similar way to figure out divisibility by 3. We can add the digits. So you add 3 plus 8 plus 0, and you get 11. And you say is this divisible by 9? And you say this is not divisible by 9, so 380 must not be divisible by 9. And for 3, you do the same thing, but you test whether the sum is divisible by 3. For 9, you test whether it's divisible by 9. So lastly, we have the number 10. We have the number 10, and this is on some level the easiest one. What do all the multiples of 10 look like? 10, 20, 30, 40, we could just keep going on and on. They all end with zero. Or if something ends with zero, it is divisible by 10. 380 does end with zero, or its ones place does have a zero on it, so it is divisible by 10. So we're divisible by all of these numbers except for 3, 6 and 9.",

        "transcript": "You're just walking down the street and someone comes up to you and says \"Quick! Quick!-- 4792. Is this divisible by 3? This is an emergency! Tell me as quickly as possible! And luckily you have a little tool in your toolkit where you know how to test for divisibility by 3 Well, you say I can just add up the digits If the sum of that is a multiple of 3 then this whole thing is a multiple of 3 So you say 4 plus 7 plus 9 plus 2 That's 11. Plus 9, it's 20. Plus 2 is 22 That's not divisible by 3 If you're unsure, you can even add the digits of that 2 plus 2 is 4. Clearly not divisible by 3 So this thing right over here is not divisible by 3 And so luckily that emergency was saved But then you walk down the street a little bit more and someone comes up to you--- \"Quick! Quick! Quick! 386,802-- Is that divisible by 3?\" Well, you employ the same tactic You say, what's 3 plus 8 plus 6 plus 8 plus 0 plus 2? 3 plus 8 is 11. Plus 6 is 17. Plus 8 is 25. Plus 2 is 27 Well, 27 is divisible by 3 And if you're unsure, you could add these digits right over here 2 plus 7 is equal to 9. Clearly divisible by 3 So this is divisible by 3 as well So now you feel pretty good You've helped two perfect strangers with their emergencies You figured out if these numbers were divisible by 3 very very very very quickly But you have a nagging feeling Because you're not quite sure why that worked You've just kind of always known it And so, let's think about why it worked To think about it, I'll just pick a random number But we could do this really for any number But I don't want to go too puffy on it just so you can see it's pretty common sense here And the number we'll use is 498 I can literally use any number in this situation And to think about why this whole little tool this little system works we just have to rewrite 498 We can rewrite the 4- since it's in the hundred's place we can write that as 4 times 100 Or 4 times 100, that's the same thing as 4 times 1 plus 99 That's all this 4 is 400, which is the same thing as 4 times 100 which is the same thing as 4 times 1 plus 99 And the little trick here is I want to write- instead of writing 100, I want to write this as the sum of 1 plus something that is divisible by 3 And 99 is divisible by 3 If I add more digits here- 999, 9999-- they're all divisible by 3 And this is why you can do the same reasoning for divisibility by 9 Because they are divisible by 9 as well Anyway, that's what the 4 in the hundred's place represents This 9 in the ten's place- well that represents 90 or 9 times 10, or 9 times 1 plus 9 And then finally this 8. That's in the one's place 8 times 1, or we just write plus 8 Now we can distribute this 4 This is 4 times 1 plus 4 times 99. So it's 4 plus 4 times 99 Actually let me write it like this. I'm going to write-- Actually let me write it first like 4 plus 4 times 99 Do the same thing over here This is the same thing as plus 9-- do that magenta color- plus 9 plus 9 times 9 And then finally I have this 8 right over here And I can rearrange everything These terms right over here, the 4 times 99, and the 9 times 9 I can write over here 4 times 99- I'll write what's like a different notation plus the 9 times the 9, that's those two terms and then we have the plus 4 plus 9 plus 8 Well, can we now tell whether this is divisible by 3? These terms, these first two terms are definitely divisible by 3 This's divisible by 3 because 99 is divisible by 3 regardless of what we have already you don't even have to look at this This is divisible by 3, so if you're multiplying it it's still going to be divisible by 3 This is divisible by 3, so if you're multiplying this whole thing it's still going to be divisible by 3 If you add two things that are divisible by 3 the whole thing is going to be divisible by 3 So all of this is divisible by 3 And if you have another digit here, you'd done the same exact thing Instead of having 1 plus 99, you'd had 1 plus 999, 1 plus 9999, etc So the only thing you have to really worry about is this part right over here you have to ask yourself in order for this whole thing to be divisible by 3 this part is- well that part is, then this part in order for the whole thing has to be divisible by 3 that also has to be divisible by 3 But what is this right over here? These are just our original digits 498. 4 and 9 and 8 We just have to make sure that when we take the sum it's divisible by 3",

The reason is that every time you go above 10, you increase the value in the tens column by 1, and decrease the value of the units by 10. The net result is that the sum of the digits decreases by 9. So it works with 3, because when you get to 12, the sum of the digits is 12-9 or 3 (which is divisible by 3). But it doesn't work with 4 because when you get to 12, you subtract 9, which isn't a multiple of 4.\n\nHowever this does means that if you were to use base 9, you would be able to use this trick on numbers divisible by 8 (i.e. 2, 4 and 8). If you use base 16, the trick works for factors of 15 (i.e. 3, 5 and 15).\n\nFor more divisibility rules see:http://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/factors-multiples/v/recognizing-divisibility\n\nHope that makes some sense."

It's a matter of life and death\", and you could say, \"Well, I can do this fairly quickly\". To figure out whether it's divisible by nine, I just have to add up the digits and figure out if the sum of the digits is a multiple of nine or whether it's divisible by nine. So let's do that. Two plus nine plus four plus three, two plus nine is 11, 11 plus four is 15, 15 plus three is 18, and 18 is definitely divisible by nine, so this is going to be divisible by nine. And even if you are unsure of whether 18 is divisible by nine you could apply the same rule again. One plus eight is equal to nine, so that's definitely, definitely divisible by nine. And so the person can go save their lives or whoever's life they were trying to save with that information. But this might leave you thinking, well, that was nice and useful, but why did that work? Does this work for all numbers? Does it only work for nine? and I don't think this works for eight, or seven, or 11, or 17, why does it work for nine? And actually also works for three, and we'll think about that in the future video. And to realize that, we just have to rewrite 2943. So the two in 2943, it's in the thousands place, so we can literally rewrite it as two times, two times 1000, the nine is in the hundreds place, so we can literally write it as nine times 100, the four is in the tens place, so it's literally the same thing as four times 10, and then finally we have our three in the ones place, we could write it as three times one or just three. This is literally 2000, 900, 40, and three, 2943. But now we can rewrite each of these things, this thousand, this hundred, this ten, as a sum of one plus something that is divisible by nine, so 1000, 1000 I can rewrite as one plus 999, one plus 999, I can rewrite 100 as one plus 99, one plus 99, I can rewrite 10 as one plus 9, and so two times 1000 is the same thing as two times one plus 999, nine times 100 is the same thing as nine times one plus 99, four times 10 is the same thing as four times one plus nine, and then I have this plus three over here. But now I can distribute, I can say, well, this over here is the same thing as two times one, which is just two, plus two times 999, this thing right over here is the same thing as nine times one, just to be clear what I'm doing, I'm distributing the two over the first parenthesis, these first two terms, then the nine, I'm gonna distribute again, so it's gonna be nine, nine times one plus nine times 99, plus nine times 99, and then over here, I forgot the plus sign right over here, I'm gonna distribute the four, four times one, so plus four, and then four times nine, so plus four times nine, and then finally I have this positive three, or plus three right over here. Now I'm just gonna rearrange this addition, so I'm gonna take all the terms we're multiplying by 999, and I'm going to do that in orange. So I'm gonna take this term, this term, and this term right over here, and so I have two times 999, that's that there, plus nine times 99, plus four times nine, plus four times nine, so that's those three terms, and then I have plus two, plus two, plus nine, plus nine, plus four, plus four, and plus three, plus three. And this is interesting, this is just the sum of our digits, this is just what we did up here, and you might see where all of this is going, this orange stuff here, is this divisible by nine? What? Sure, it will definitely, 999, that's divisible by nine, so anything this is multiplying by, it's divisible by nine, so this is divisible by nine, this is definitely divisible by nine, 99, regardless of whether is being multiplied by nine, whatever is multiplying by nine, whatever is multiplying 99 is gonna be divisible by nine, because 99 is divisible by nine, so this works out, and same thing over here, you're always going to be multiplying by a multiple of nine, so all of this business all over here is definitely going to be divisible by nine. And so in order for the whole thing, and all I did is I rewrote 2943 like this right over here, in order for the whole thing to be divisible by nine, this part definitely is divisible by nine, in order for the whole thing does the rest of this sum, it has to be divisible by nine as well. So in order for this whole thing, all of this has to be divisible, divisible by nine.",

So it doesn't work.\n\nHowever, as one person suggested but didn\u2019t complete, you can see that if the number were divisible by 2 and 3 then that would make the number divisible by 6. So if the number ends in an even number (0,2,4,6,8) and the digits sum to a number divisible by 3, then the original number is divisible by 6. So for 18:\nIt ends in 8, which is even, so 18 is divisible by 2.\n1+8=9, which is divisible by 3, so 18 is divisible by 3.\nSince the number 18 is divisible by both 2 and 3, then it is divisible by 6."

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] In this video I wanna do a bunch of example problems that show up on standardized exams and definitely will help you with our divisibility module because it's asking you questions like this. And this is just one of the examples. All numbers divisible by both 12 and 20 are also divisible by: And the trick here is to realize that if a number is divisible by both 12 and 20, it has to be divisible by each of these guy's prime factors. So let's take the prime factorization, the prime factorization of 12, let's see, 12 is 2 times 6. 6 isn't prime yet so 6 is 2 times 3. So that is prime. So any number divisible by 12 needs to be divisible by 2 times 2 times 3. So its prime factorization needs to have a 2 times a 2 times a 3 in it, any number that's divisible by 12. Now any number that's divisible by 20 needs to be divisible by, let's take it's prime factorization. 2 times 10 10 is 2 times 5. So any number divisible by 20 needs to also be divisible by 2 times 2 times 5. Or another way of thinking about it, it needs to have two 2's and a 5 in its prime factorization. If you're divisible by both, you have to have two 2's, a 3, and a 5, two 2's and a 3 for 12, and then two 2's and a 5 for 20, and you can verify this for yourself that this is divisible by both. Obviously if you divide it by 20, let me do it this way. Dividing it by 20 is the same thing as dividing by 2 times 2 times 5, so you're going to have the 2's are going to cancel out, the 5's are going to cancel out. You're just going to have a 3 left over. So it's clearly divisible by 20, and if you were to divide it by 12, you'd divide it by 2 times 2 times 3. This is the same thing as 12. And so these guys would cancel out and you would just have a 5 left over so it's clearly divisible by both, and this number right here is 60. It's 4 times 3, which is 12, times 5, it's 60. This right here is actually the least common multiple of 12 and 20. Now this isn't the only number that's divisible by both 12 and 20. You could multiply this number right here by a whole bunch of other factors. I could call them a, b, and c, but this is kind of the smallest number that's divisible by 12 and 20. Any larger number will also be divisible by the same things as this smaller number. Now with that said, let's answer the questions. All numbers divisible by both 12 and 20 are also divisible by: Well we don't know what these numbers are so we can't really address it. They might just be 1's or they might not exist because the number might be 60. It might be 120. Who knows what this number is? So the only numbers that we know can be divided into this number, well we know 2 can be, we know that 2 is a legitimate answer. 2 is obviously divisible into 2 times 2 times 3 times 5. We know that 2 times 2 is divisible into it, cuz we have the 2 times 2 over there. We know that 3 is divisible into it. We know that 2 times 3 is divisible into it. So that's 6. Let me write these. This is 4. This is 6. We know that 2 times 2 times 3 is divisible into it. I could go through every combination of these numbers right here. We know that 3 times 5 is divisible into it. We know that 2 times 3 times 5 is divisible into it. So in general you can look at these prime factors and any combination of these prime factors is divisible into any number that's divisible by both 12 and 20, so if this was a multiple choice question, and the choices were 7 and 9 and 12 and 8. You would say, well let's see, 7 is not one of these prime factors over here. 9 is 3 times 3 so I need to have two 3's here. I only have one 3 here so 9 doesn't work. 7 doesn't work, 9 doesn't work. 12 is 4 times 3 or another way to think about it, 12 is 2 times 2 times 3. Well there is a 2 times 2 times 3 in the prime factorization, of this least common multiple of these two numbers, so this is a 12 so 12 would work. 8 is 2 times 2 times 2. You would need three 2's in the prime factorization. We don't have three 2's, so this doesn't work. Let's try another example just so that we make sure that we understand this fairly well. So let's say we wanna know, we ask the same question. All numbers divisible by and let me think of two interesting numbers, all numbers divisible by 12 and let's say 9, and I don't know, let's make it more interesting, 9 and 24 are also divisible by are also divisible by And once again we just do the prime factorization. We essentially think about the least common multiple of 9 and 24. You take the prime factorization of 9, it's 3 times 3 and we're done. Prime factorization of 24 is 2 times 12. 12 is 2 times 6, 6 is 2 times 3. So anything that's divisible by 9 has to have a 9 in it's factorization or if you did its prime factorization would have to be a 3 times 3, anything divisible by 24 has got to have three 2's in it, so it's gotta have a 2 times a 2 times a 2, and it's got to have at lease one 3 here. And we already have at least one 3 from the 9, so we have that. So this number right here is divisible by both 9 and 24. And this number right here is actually 72. This is 8 times 9, which is 72. So if the choices for this question, let's assume that it was multiple choice. Let's say the choices here were 16 27 5 11 and 9. So 16, if you were to do its prime factorization, is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2. It's 2 to the 4th power. So you would need four 2's here. We don't have four 2's over here. I mean there could be some other numbers here but we don't know what they are. These are the only numbers that we can assume are in the prime factorization of something divisible by both 9 and 24. So we can rule out 16. We don't have four 2's here. 27 is equal to 3 times 3 times 3, so you need three 3's in the prime factorization. We don't have three 3's. We only have two of them. So once again, cancel that out. 5's a prime number. There are no 5's here. Rule that out. 11, once again, prime number. No 11's here. Rule that out. 9 is equal to 3 times 3. And actually I just realized that this is a silly answer because obviously all numbers divisible by 9 and 24 are also divisible by 9. So obviously 9 is going to work but I shouldn't have made that a choice cuz that's in the problem, but 9 would work, and what also would work if we had a, if 8 was one of the choices, because 8 is equal to 2 times 2 times 2, and we have a 2 times 2 times 2 here. 4 would also work. That's 2 times 2. That's 2 times 2. 6 would work since that's 2 times 3. 18 would work cuz that's 2 times 3 times 3. So anything that's made up of a combination of these prime factors will be divisible into something divisible by both 9 and 24. Hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.",

So move on to breaking down the next answer in the list into factors even if you haven't completely factored that answer. It's good to make the habit of checking at each level of the factor \"tree\" to see if either one is a prime (from a list of primes) before trying to divide them out for the next level.

        "transcript": "Write the prime factorization of 75. Write your answer using exponential notation. So we have a couple of interesting things here. Prime factorization, and they say exponential notation. We'll worry about the exponential notation later. So the first thing we have to worry about is what is even a prime number? And just as a refresher, a prime number is a number that's only divisible by itself and one, so examples of prime numbers-- let me write some numbers down. Prime, not prime. So 2 is a prime number. It's only divisible by 1 and 2. 3 is another prime number. Now, 4 is not prime, because this is divisible by 1, 2 and 4. We could keep going. 5, well, 5 is only divisible by 1 and 5, so 5 is prime. 6 is not prime, because it's divisible by 2 and 3. I think you get the general idea. You move to 7, 7 is prime. It's only divisible by 1 and 7. 8 is not prime. 9 you might be tempted to say is prime, but remember, it's also divisible by 3, so 9 is not prime. Prime is not the same thing as odd numbers. Then if you move to 10, 10 is also not prime, divisible by 2 and 5. 11, it's only divisible by 1 and 11, so 11 is then a prime number. And we could keep going on like this. People have written computer programs looking for the highest prime and all of that. So now that we know what a prime is, a prime factorization is breaking up a number, like 75, into a product of prime numbers. So let's try to do that. So we're going to start with 75, and I'm going to do it using what we call a factorization tree. So we first try to find just the smallest prime number that will go into 75. Now, the smallest prime number is 2. Does 2 go into 75? Well, 75 is an odd number, or the number in the ones place, this 5, is an odd number. 5 is not divisible by 2, so 2 will not go into 75. So then we could try 3. Does 3 go into 75? Well, 7 plus 5 is 12. 12 is divisible by 3, so 3 will go into it. So 75 is 3 times something else. And if you've ever dealt with change, you know that if you have three quarters, you have 75 cents, or if you have 3 times 25, you have 75. So this is 3 times 25. And you can multiply this out if you don't believe me. Multiple out 3 times 25. Now, is 25 divisible by-- you can give up on 2. If 75 wasn't divisible by 2, 25's not going to be divisible by 2 either. But maybe 25 is divisible by 3 again. So if you take the digits 2 plus 5, you get 7. 7 is not divisible by 3, so 25 will not be divisible by 3. So we keep moving up: 5. Is 25 divisible by 5? Well, sure. It's 5 times 5. So 25 is 5 times 5. And we're done with our prime factorization because now we have all prime numbers here. So we can write that 75 is 3 times 5 times 5. So 75 is equal to 3 times 5 times 5. We can say it's 3 times 25. 25 is 5 times 5. 3 times 25, 25 is 5 times 5. So this is a prime factorization, but they want us to write our answer using exponential notation. So that just means, if we have repeated primes, we can write those as an exponent. So what is 5 times 5? 5 times 5 is 5 multiplied by itself two times. This is the same thing as 5 to the second power. So if we want to write our answer using exponential notation, we could say this is equal to 3 times 5 to the second power, which is the same thing as 5 times 5.",

So let's start with the smallest prime number we know, and that is 2. And think about, does 2 go into 36? Well, sure, it does. 36 is 2 times 18. So we can write that down. 36 is 2 times 18. So now we have 36 as a product of a prime number, and 18 is clearly a composite number. It has factors other than 1 and 18. So let's try to factor this further. So is this divisible by 2? Sure. 18 is 2 times 9. So now 9 is a composite number that we haven't fully factored. Obviously, the 2's are both prime. 9 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3. 9 is 3 times 3. So we can say that 36 is equal to 2 times 2 times 3 times 3. This is its prime factorization. All of these numbers are prime. So now let's input that to make sure we got it right. 2 times 2 times 3 times 3. And you can check yourself. If you have the product of numbers that are all prime and the product actually is 36, you have successfully prime factorized the number. Let's do a couple more of these. What is the prime factorization of 30? So I'll get my scratch paper out again. So we'll do the same process. So 30-- well, it's divisible by 2. So we can write that as 2 times 15. 15 isn't divisible by 2. But it is divisible by 3. It's the same thing as 3 times 5. And both 3 and 5 are prime numbers. They are only divisible by 1 and themselves. So the prime factorization of 30 is 2 times 3 times 5. Let's enter that in. So it is 2 times 3 times 5. Let's do one more of these. What is the prime factorization of 73? Now, 73 is interesting. I'll get my scratch paper out for this. We could try to factor 73. So you might try 2. Well, this is clearly an odd number. So 2 isn't going to be divisible into 73. You might try 3. You would immediately see, well, 3 is divisible into 72. If you divide into 73, you have a remainder of 1. Well, 4 isn't a prime number, so we wouldn't even try. 5 isn't divisible into 73. It doesn't end in a 5 or 0. 7 is not divisible into 73. 7 goes into 70, so you'd have a remainder of 3. 11 isn't divisible into 73. It's divisible into 66 or 77, so not 73. As I test more and more numbers, it doesn't look like there's any easy thing that divides into 73. So I'm willing to go with 73 itself is a prime number. So this is its prime factorization. It's just 73. So let's write that down. So the answer here, let's just write 73. And you don't want to write 1 times 73, because 1 is not a prime number. Remember, 1 only has one factor, itself. A prime number has two factors, 1 and itself. Two different prime factors-- 1 and itself. And itself is not one. So we just want to write prime numbers here. 73 is a prime number.

Roughly estimating, 25 squared is 625 and 30 squared is 900, so it will be in between, but since 29 is the only prime and that is too close to 30 (29 squared will be 900 - 30 - 29 = 841), we actually only need to go up to 23. So the numbers we need to check are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 and 23.\n\nWe can tell it won't be divisible by 2 since it's not even; it won't be divisible by 3 since the digits don't sum to a multiple of 3 (https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/factors-multiples/divisibility_tests/v/the-why-of-the-3-divisibility-rule); and we know it's not divisible by 5 as it doesn't end in a 5. So that leaves us with just six numbers to check, and those we would have to check one by one, which I agree is a pain.\n\nIn fact there are also tricks to test whether something is divisible by 7 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule#Divisibility_by_7) and 11 (http://www.wikihow.com/Check-Divisibility-of-11), but they require a bit more work. For 7, I would just think, if 757 were divisible by 7, then if we subtract multiples of 7 the results would have to be divisible by 7. Subtracting 7, gets us 750, subtracting 700, gets us 50 and that's not divisible by 7, so 757 is also not. So now we're down to four numbers"

You could think of it like taking a car engine to pieces and putting them together again, to understand how the engine works.\n\nOne important use of prime factorisation is in making (or breaking!) encrypted data. Encryption of data keeps it secure and stops people other than the intended recipient from looking at the data. We all rely on data encryption, especially people that handle sensitive data such as governments and businesses. If data encryption stopped working then it would make our societies very difficult to run!\n\nOther applications of prime numbers relate to mathematical theory.

And they just say, another way to say this is the GCD, or greatest common divisor, of 20 of 40 is equal to question mark. And greatest common divisor sounds like a very fancy term, but it's really just saying, what is the largest number that is divisible into both 20 and 40? Well, this seems like a pretty straightforward situation, because 20 is actually divisible into 40. Or another way to say it is 40 can be divided by 20 without a remainder. So the largest number that is a-- I guess you could say-- factor of both 20 and 40 is actually 20. 20 is 20 times 1, and 40 is 20 times 2. So in this situation, we don't even have to break out our paper. We can just write 20. Let's do a couple more of these. So we're asked, what is the greatest common divisor of 10 and 7? So let's now break out our paper for this. So our greatest common divisor of 10 and 7. So let me write that down. So we have 10. We want to think about what is our GCD of 10 and 7? And there's two ways that you can approach this. One way, you could literally list all of the factors-- not prime factors, just regular factors-- of each of these numbers and figure out which one is greater or what is the largest factor of both. So, for example, you could say, well, I got a 10, and 10 can be expressed 1 times 10 or 2 times 5. 1, 2, 5, and 10. These are all factors of 10. These are all, we could say, divisors of 10. And sometimes this is called greatest common factor. Seven-- what are all of its factors? Well, 7 is prime. It only has two factors-- 1 and itself. So what is the greatest common factor? Well, there's only one common factor here, 1. 1 is the only common factor. So the greatest common factor of 10 and 7, or the greatest common divisor, is going to be equal to 1. So let's write that down. 1. Let's do one more. What is the greatest common divisor of 21 and 30? And this is just another way of saying that. So 21 and 30 are the two numbers that we care about. So we want to figure out the greatest common divisor, and I could have written greatest common factor, of 21 and 30. So once again, there's two ways of doing this. And so there's the way I did the last time where I literally list all the factors. Let me do it that way really fast. So if I say 21, what are all the factors? Well, it's 1 and 21, and 3, and 7. I think I've got all of them. And 30 can be written as 1 and 30, 2 and 15, and 3-- actually, I'm going to run out of them. Let me write it this way so I get a little more space. So 1 and 30. 2 and 15. 3 and 10. And 5 and 6. So here are all of the factors of 30. And now what are the common factors? Well, 1 is a common factor. 3 is also a common factor. But what is the greatest common factor or the greatest common divisor? Well, it is going to be 3. So we could write 3 here. Now, I keep talking about another technique. Let me show you the other technique, and that involves the prime factorization. So if you say the prime factorization of 21-- well, let's see, it's divisible by 3. It is 3 times 7. And the prime factorization of 30 is equal to 3 times 10, and 10 is 2 times 5. So what are the most factors that we can take from both 21 and 30 to make the largest possible numbers? So when you look at the prime factorization, the only thing that's common right over here is a 3. And so we would say that the greatest common factor or the greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3. If you saw nothing in common right over here, then you say the greatest common divisor is one. Let me give you another interesting example, just so that we can get a sense of things. So let's say these two numbers were not 21 and 30, but let's say we care about the greatest common divisor not of 21, but let's say of 105 and 30. So if we did the prime factorization method, it might become a little clearer now. Actually figuring out, hey, what are all the factors of 105 might be a little bit of a pain, but if you do a prime factorization, you'd say, well, let's see, 105-- it's divisible by 5, definitely. So it's 5 times 21, and 21 is 3 times 7. So the prime factorization of 105 is equal to-- if I write them in increasing order-- 3 times 5 times 7. The prime factorization of 30, we already figured out is 30 is equal to 2 times 3 times 5. So what's the most number of factors or prime factors that they have in common? Well, these two both have a 3, and they both have a 5. So the greatest common factor or greatest common divisor is going to be a product of these two. In this situation, the GCD of 105 and 30 is 3 times 5, is equal to 15. So you could do it either way. You could just list out the traditional divisors or factors and, say, figure out which of those is common and is the greatest. Or you can break it down into its core constituencies, its prime factors, and then figure out what is the largest set of common prime factors, and the product of those is going to be your greatest common factor. It's the largest number that is divisible into both numbers.",

        "transcript": "Welcome to the greatest common divisor or greatest common factor video. So just to be clear, first of all, when someone asks you whether what's the greatest common divisor of 12 and 8? Or they ask you what's the greatest common factor of 12 and 8? That's a c right there for common. I don't know why it came out like that. They're asking you the same thing. I mean, really a divisor is just a number that can divide into something, and a factor-- well, I think, that's also a number that can divide into something. So a divisor and a factor are kind of the same thing. So with that out of the way, let's figure out, what is the greatest common divisor or the greatest common factor of 12 and 8? Well, what we do is, it's pretty straightforward. First we just figure out the factors of each of the numbers. So first let's write all of the factors out of the number 12. Well, 1 is a factor, 2 goes into 12. 3 goes into 12. 4 goes into 12. 5 does not to go into 12. 6 goes into 12 because 2 times 6. And then, 12 goes into 12 of course. 1 times 12. So that's the factors of 12. Let's write the factors of 8. Well, 1 goes into 8. 2 goes into 8. 3 does not go into 8. 4 does go into 8. And then the last factor, pairing up with the 1 is 8. So now we've written all the factors of 12 and 8. So let's figure out what the common factors of 12 and 8 are. Well, they both have the common factor of 1. And that's really not so special. Pretty much every whole number or every integer has the common factor of 1. They both share the common factor 2 and they both share the common factor 4. So we're not just interested in finding a common factor, we're interested in finding the greatest common factor. So all the common factors are 1, 2 and 4. And what's the greatest of them? Well, that's pretty easy. It's 4. So the greatest common factor of 12 and 8 is 4. Let me write that down just for emphasis. Greatest common factor of 12 and 8 equals 4. And of course, we could have just as easily had said, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 8 equals 4. Sometimes it does things a little funny. Let's do another problem. What is the greatest common divisor of 25 and 20? Well, let's do it the same way. The factors of 25? Well, it's 1. 2 doesn't go into it. 3 doesn't go into it. 4 doesn't go into it. 5 does. It's actually 5 times 5. And then 25. It's interesting that this only has 3 factors. I'll leave you to think about why this number only has 3 factors and other numbers tend to have an even number of factors. And then now we do the factors of 20. Factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. And if we just look at this by inspection we see, well, they both share 1, but that's nothing special. But they both have the common factor of? You got it-- 5. So the greatest common divisor or greatest common factor of 25 and 20- well, that equals 5. Let's do another problem. What is the greatest common factor of 5 and 12? Well, factors of 5? Pretty easy. 1 and 5. That's because it's a prime number. It has no factors other than 1 and itself. Then the factors of 12? 12 has a lot of factors. It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. So it really looks like only common factor they share is 1. So that was, I guess, in some ways kind of disappointing. So the greatest common factor of 5 and 12 is 1. And I'll throw out some terminology here for you. When two numbers have a greatest common factor of only 1, they're called relatively prime. And that kind of makes sense because a prime number is something that only has 1 and itself as a factor. And two relatively prime numbers are numbers that only have 1 as their greatest common factor. Hope I didn't confuse you. Let's do another problem. Let's do the greatest common divisor of 6 and 12. I know 12's coming up a lot. I'll try to be more creative when I think of my numbers. Well, the greatest common divisor of 6 and 12? Well, it's the factors of 6. Are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3-- we should have these memorized by now. 3, 4, 6, and 12. Well, it turns out 1 is a common factor of both. 2 is also a common factor of both. 3 is a common factor of both. And 6 is a common factor of both. And of course, what's the greatest common factor? Well, it's 6. And that's interesting. So in this situation the greatest common divisor-- and I apologize that I keep switching between divisor and factor. The mathematics community should settle on one of the two. The greatest common divisor of 6 and 12 equals 6. So it actually equals one of the numbers. And that makes a lot of sense because 6 actually is divisible into 12. Well, that's it for now. Hopefully you're ready to do the greatest common divisor or factor problems. I think I might make another module in the near future that'll give you more example problems.",

In that, we must take the two numbers who's HCF we want, beside each other. Then, we find prime numbers that are divisible by both the numbers and then divide the numbers. We carry on this process until we reach 1 by continuously dividing both the numbers. Then we multiply all the prime numbers on the left to get the HCF. If this process is kinda difficult, I'd recommend you to watch and try the Euclid's division algorithm to find HCF - https://youtu.be/H1AE2Se8A5E I found it simple and easy. Hopes that you will too."

        "transcript": "What is the least common multiple of 36 and 12? So another way to say this is LCM, in parentheses, 36 to 12. And this is literally saying what's the least common multiple of 36 and 12? Well, this one might pop out at you, because 36 itself is a multiple of 12. And 36 is also a multiple of 36. It's 1 times 36. So the smallest number that is both a multiple of 36 and 12-- because 36 is a multiple of 12-- is actually 36. There we go. Let's do a couple more of these. That one was too easy. What is the least common multiple of 18 and 12? And they just state this with a different notation. The least common multiple of 18 and 12 is equal to question mark. So let's think about this a little bit. So there's a couple of ways you can think about-- so let's just write down our numbers that we care about. We care about 18, and we care about 12. So there's two ways that we could approach this. One is the prime factorization approach. We can take the prime factorization of both of these numbers and then construct the smallest number whose prime factorization has all of the ingredients of both of these numbers, and that will be the least common multiple. So let's do that. 18 is 2 times 9, which is the same thing as 2 times 3 times 3, or 18 is 2 times 9. 9 is 3 times 3. So we could write 18 is equal to 2 times 3 times 3. That's its prime factorization. 12 is 2 times 6. 6 is 2 times 3. So 12 is equal to 2 times 2 times 3. Now, the least common multiple of 18 and 12-- let me write this down-- so the least common multiple of 18 and 12 is going to have to have enough prime factors to cover both of these numbers and no more, because we want the least common multiple or the smallest common multiple. So let's think about it. Well, it needs to have at least 1, 2, a 3 and a 3 in order to be divisible by 18. So let's write that down. So we have to have a 2 times 3 times 3. This makes it divisible by 18. If you multiply this out, you actually get 18. And now let's look at the 12. So this part right over here-- let me make it clear. This part right over here is the part that makes up 18, makes it divisible by 18. And then let's see. 12, we need two 2's and a 3. Well, we already have one 3, so our 3 is taken care of. We have one 2, so this 2 is taken care of. But we don't have two 2s's. So we need another 2 here. So, notice, now this number right over here has a 2 times 2 times 3 in it, or it has a 12 in it, and it has a 2 times 3 times 3, or an 18 in it. So this right over here is the least common multiple of 18 and 12. If we multiply it out, so 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 3 is 12. 12 times 3 is equal to 36. And we are done. Now, the other way you could've done it is what I would say just the brute force method of just looking at the multiples of these numbers. You would say, well, let's see. The multiples of 18 are 18, 36, and I could keep going higher and higher, 54. And I could keep going. And the multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36. And immediately I say, well, I don't have to go any further. I already found a multiple of both, and this is the smallest multiple of both. It is 36. You might say, hey, why would I ever do this one right over here as opposed to this one? A couple of reasons. This one, you're kind of-- it's fun, because you're actually decomposing the number and then building it back up. And also, this is a better way, especially if you're doing it with really, really large and hairy numbers. Really, really, really large and hairy numbers where you keep trying to find all the multiples, you might have to go pretty far to actually figure out what their least common multiple is. Here, you'll be able to do it a little bit more systematically, and you'll know what you're doing.",

they sound like dumb questions and get to the bottom of what we're really trying to understand so let's do that with LCM today let's try and look at the LCM with a new pair of eyes so let's say two small numbers say 12 and 18 and ask if I have to find the LCM of these two numbers using prime factorization what's tip number one for us the step number one is to go to 12 and ask hey 12 what are your prime factors and then go to 18 and ask hey teen what are your prime factors now I did that and they told me 12 told me that it has two twos and one 3 and 18 told me that it has one two and two threes now is the time to stop and think about how to use this information to arrive at our LCM and in a previous video we did the same thing for the head CF may be visualized in a diagram y thinking about prime factors makes it easier to find the HCF that's not a strictly needed video but you may find this video much more fun if you watch that video as well so with that let's jump in and ask how to find the LCM with this information that we have right now and the first question to ask is what is the LCM really what is it isn't the LCM the first multiple of both 12 and 18 that's pretty much it right in other words if I start at the number line at 12 and keeps jumping size 12 and started 18 and keeps jumping size 18 at some point these two will have to meet and the first place where they meet is what we call the LCM so then now that we know this let's ask what should the LCM be the else 'i'm just needs to contain enough factors of both 12 and 18 so that it's a multiple of both of them think about that so what LCM is goes to 12 and asks hey 12 I'm trying to be or LCM I'm auditioning to be or LCM so what do I need how many twos do you have and 12 says so I have to do and it seems is okay I definitely need two twos then only then will I be a multiple of yours if I have only one two or zero two is I can never be a multiple of you forget being a multiple of 18 so I have two twos know how many threes do you have and Torres's oh I have one three and LCM says okay cool I'll have one three as well and then it asks 12 anything else and well says no I have nothing else so LCM is now happy I have at least covered 12 and I have not I don't yet know about 18 but I definitely know that I'm your multiple now let me go to 18 and find out the Newseum goes to 18 and asks hey woody you need I'm trying to be or LCM what do I need to have to be able to cover you and 18 says oh me I have one too the LCM looks and Sciences that's great I in fact I have two twos so no worries are all I have an extra two even though you don't need it and then LCM asks what else do you need an 18 says I need two threes to be my multiple if you have to be my multiple you need two threes at least and the LCM says oh I have only one three that twelve wanted me to have okay I can add another three so now I have two threes as well and the LCM is 18 anything else and LCM says no no Phi's with me no seven is nothing else CLC was happy the LCM says now I have the exact minimum things that I need to have to be the LCM of 12 and 18 and if you find the answer do this you will know what the LCM of these two numbers is right and you guaranteed that this number will be a cm which is a common multiple of both 12 and 18 because 223 is here already that's 12 and 2 into 3 into 3 is here that's 18 but what you also know is you have not included anything unnecessarily so you know this will be or else 'i'm right so to reduce 4 into 3 into 3 is 9 so 36 is your else 'i'm now let's visualize this in a different way now the way i like to do it is to imagine 12 to be a circle like this containing its prime factors and 18 as well like this now how is the LCM connected in this picture how should you think of finding the LCM using the picture if I were to do it what I'll do is that hey I'm still the LCM I'll go ask 12 what are your factors I need to be your multiple first if I have to be a multiple of both of you I first need to be at least your multiple and I could have picked 12 or 18 first I'm just picking 12 first so 12 LCM says okay I need to contain everything that you you contain so 2 into 2 & 2 3 that will make me your multiple great now I have another job I also need to be the multiple of 18 so I'll go to 18 and a squaddie you need an 18 says I need 2 into 3 into 3 but before adding these also to the LCM bucket the LCM realizes wait wait it's possible that some things that you need 18 were already covered by 12 so I have to ask 12 and you what's common between the two of you because whatever is common I've already covered so that's what the LCM does it wants to find out what's common and the way to do that is to just observe what's common between the two you'll notice that there's 1 2 + 1 3 that's common and because that's the case this 2 3 that you see for 18 has already been covered by becoming a multiple of 12 and that's beautiful if you think about it that part is already covered so L see you just needs to cover this extra 3 and eating will also be covered it doesn't have to cover those two and three again because it was covered for 12 now in that way when you look at it the LCM is simply this 2 multiplied by the 2 into 3 that's common which you see over here multiplied by the 3 that's not common between 12 and 18 there's an extra 3 in 18 that's not covered if you become a multiple of 12 so you only need to multiply that and now I have a question and the question is can you look at this diagram and also figure out what the head CF is notice that just by drawing the building blocks of 12 and the building blocks of 18 and bringing them together bringing them together so that the 2 and 3 of 18 and the 2 and 3 of 12 in this case those are the common factors bringing them together like this gives us both the head CF and the LCM in one diagram beautifully because once you have done this the head C is simply the common factors multiplied with each other we went really deep into this in in the previous video so 3 into 2 will be the head CF which is 6 and whatever is visible once you do this multiplied together will be or LCM 2 into 203 which is over here into 3 and now you also know why this is true I find this really beautiful let's do one more example to really understand this even better so let's take all of these out and let's take our two new numbers 120 and 84 just like we had for head CF and pause right now and think about the find the prime factors of 120 draw a diagram for it prime factors of 84 draw the diagram for it observe what's common and notice that when you merge them whatever you can see multiplied together will be your LCM I'm going to do it right now for 120 I have three twos and 1 3 and 1 5 so I have 2 cubed or three twos the short form of writing that is 2 cubed right into 3 into 5 and 484 I have two twos 1 3 and 1 7 equals 2 2 is 1 which is 2 square into 3 into 7 now finding the LCM simply becomes including all the things already included in one number so if I write the LCM out of here the LCM that'll simply be equal to 2 cube into 3 into 5 which is basically just all the numbers that 120 needs to cubed into 3 into 5 and then all the things that 84 needs that were not already covered by 120 and to find that we just find what's common and more it's the diagram whatever was what does what's part of it 84 that's already covered two twos and one three so that's already covered which means the only thing left to be covered is another 7 so you multiply by that 7 as well and then you have your LCM so let's find out what the LCM is it's 75 so 35 into 3 is 105 105 + 2 8 that's 840 840 I hope that's correct so the LCM is all the things that are visible once you merge it so that you're not counting the common factors twice because you don't need to I remember the head SIA was actually also available in this diagram directly for us the NCAA is just all these multiplied together which is two hundred one two three which is 12 so everything that we need and now is a good time to pause and ask hey how is this diagram and this way of thinking about it connect it to the metals that I'm already used to now one of the methods I was used to was writing the LCM as looking at each of the prime factors say to first and noticing what's the maximum power and then I'll write that so the maximum power in this case is 2 cubed and then go to the next one 3 3 power 1 here 3 power 1 here so into 3 5 power one here no 5 year that can be taken as 5 power 0 so taking 5 power 1 and then no 7 nothing else over here but there's one 7 here and no 7 here so taking the maximum power of that which is 1 7 notice it's exactly the same thing that you have done here and the reason you're taking the maximum power is that if one person needs to the three twos and the other person needs only two by taking the maximum you're ensuring that everybody will be happy even if there are more and more numbers as long as you have taken the maximum power of a prime factor you know everybody else will be satisfied so it makes sense to do this there's another method you may have been used to which is this way of writing things like underlined write and draw a line keep going have you done this so if you have then what you're doing is actually first finding whatever is coming 2 into 2 to 3 because you keep dividing by both the numbers and if you stop right here you get the head CF 200 203 right and then what do you start doing if you're finding the LCM is that you start looking at whatever is divisible by even one number so this in this case is to only goes in ten so you write that and then you keep finding out whatever is not common so tell you here is your what I can call your common part after which begins your not common part and observe how that neatly ties in this diagram - 2 - n - 3 is over here you multiply that alone you get your head CF there's 2 into 5 that's left behind on the 120 side and there's another 7 that is left behind on the 84 side and you multiply all of these together you were told that you'd find the LCM but now you know exactly why",

And I'm going to do this using the prime factorization method which I just like more. Let's find the prime factorization of both of these numbers. So 30, it's divisible by 2. It's 2 times 15. 15 is 3 times 5. And now we've expressed 30 as the product of only prime numbers, 2 times 3 times 5. Now let's do the same thing for 25. 25 is-- well that's just 5 times 5. So let me write that down. 25 is equal to 5 times 5. Now to find the least common multiple, let me write this down, the least common multiple of 30 and 25 is going to have a number whose prime factorization is a super set of both of these or has all of these numbers in them as many times as we have in any one of these. So it's the least common multiple. Well it has to be divisible by 30. So it's going to need a 2 times a 3 times a 5. This is what makes it divisible by 30. But it needs to also be divisible by 25. And in order to be divisible by 25, you need to have two 5s in your prime factorization. Right now our prime factorization only has one 5. So let's throw. So we have one 5 right over here. We need another 5. So let's throw another 5 right over here. So now this thing clearly has a 25 in it. It's clearly divisible by 25. And this is the least common multiple. I could have, if we just wanted a common multiple, we could have thrown more factors here and it would have definitely been divisible by 30 or 25, but this has the bare minimum of prime factors necessary to be divisible by 30 and 25. If I got rid of any one of these, I wouldn't be divisible by both anymore. If I got rid of this 2, I wouldn't be divisible by 30 anymore. If I got rid of one of the 5s, I wouldn't be divisible by 25 anymore. So let's just multiply it out. This is essentially the prime factorization of our least common multiple. And this is equal to 2 times 3 is 6, 6 times 5 is 30, 30 times 5 is equal to 150. And of course, we can check our answer, 150. Check it, and we got it right.",

        },
        "transcript": "What is the least common multiple, abbreviated as LCM, of 15, 6, and 10? So the least common multiple is exactly what the word is saying. It's the least common multiple of these numbers. And I know that probably didn't help you much. But let's actually work through this problem. So to do that, let's just think about the different multiples of the 15, 6, and 10 and then find at the smallest multiple, the least multiple, they have in common. So let's find the multiples of 15. So you have 1 times 15 is 15. 2 times 15 is 30. Then if you add 15 again, you get 45. You add 15 again, you get 60. You add 15 again, you get 75. You add 15 again, you get 90. You add 15 again, you get 105. And if still none of these are common multiples with these guys over here, then we might have to go further. But I'll stop there for now. So that's the multiples of 15 up through 105. Obviously, we can keep going from there. Now, let's do the multiples of 6. 1 times 6 is 6. 2 times 6 is 12. 3 times 6 is 18. 4 times 6 is 24. 5 times 6 is 30. 6 times 6 is 36. 7 times 6 is 42. 8 times 6 is 48. 9 times 6 is 54. 10 times 6 is 60. 60 already looks interesting, because it is a common multiple of both 15 and 60, although we have two of them over here. We have a 30, and we have a 30. We have a 60 and a 60. So the smallest common multiple, so if we only cared about the least common multiple of 15 and 6, we would say it's 30. So let me write this down as an intermediate. The LCM of 15 and 6, so the least common multiple, the smallest multiple that they have in common, we see over here. 15 times 2 is 30. And 6 times 5 is 30. So this is definitely a common multiple. And it's the smallest of all of their common multiples. 60 is also a common multiple. But it's a bigger one. This is the least common multiple. So this is 30. Well, we haven't thought about the 10 yet. So let's bring the 10 in there. And I think you already see where this is going. Let's do the multiples of 10. They are 10, 20, 30, 40. Well, we already went far enough, because we already got to 30. And 30 is a common multiple of 15 and 6. And it's the smallest common multiple of all of them. So it's actually the fact that the LCM of 15, 6, and 10 is equal to 30. Now, this is one way to find the least common multiple. Literally just look at the multiples of each of the number and then see what the smallest multiple they have is in common. Another way to do that is to look at the prime factorization of each of these numbers. And the least common multiple is the number that has all of the elements of the prime factorizations of these and nothing else. So let me show you what I mean by that. So you could do it this way. Or you could say 15 is the same thing as 3 times 5. And that's it. That's its prime factorization. 15 is 3 times 5. Both 3 and 5 are prime. We can say that 6 is the same thing as 2 times 3. That's it. That's its prime factorization. Both 2 and 3 are prime. And then we can say that 10 is the same thing as 2 times 5. Both 2 and 5 are prime. So we're done factoring it. And so the least common multiple of 15, 6, and 10 just needs to have all of these prime factors. And what I mean, to be clear, is in order to be divisible by 15, it has to have at least one 3 and one 5 in its prime factorization. So it has to have at least one 3 and at least one 5. By having a 3 times 5 in its prime factorization, that ensures that this number is divisible by 15. To be divisible by 6, it has to have at least one 2 and one 3. So it has to have at least one 2. And we already have a 3 over here. So that's all we want. We just need one 3. So one 2 and one 3, this 2 times 3, ensures that we are divisible by 6. And let me make it clear. This right here is the 15. And then to make sure that we're divisible by 10, we have to have at least one 2 and one 5. These two over here make sure that we are divisible by 10. And so we have all of them. This 2 times 3 times 5 has all of the prime factors of either 10, 6, or 15. So it is the least common multiple. And so if you multiply this out, you will get 2 times 3 is 6. 6 times 5 is 30. So either way, hopefully, both of these resonate with you. And you see why they make sense. This second way is a little bit better if you're trying to do it for really complex numbers, numbers where you might have to be multiplying it for a long time. Either way, both of these are valid ways of finding the least common multiple.",

            "9:32": "it means to subtract a negative number."
        },
        "transcript": "In this video, I want to familiarize ourselves with negative numbers, and also learn a bit of how do we add and subtract them. And when you first encounter them, they look like this deep and mysterious thing. When we first count things, we're counting positive numbers. What does a negative number even mean? But when we think about it, you probably have encountered negative numbers in your everyday life. And let me just give you a few examples. So before I actually give the example, the general idea is a negative number is any number less than the 0. And if that sounds strange and abstract to you, let's just think about it in a couple of different contexts. If we're measuring the temperature-- and it could be in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Let's just assume we're measuring it in Celsius. And so, let me draw a little scale that we can measure the temperature on. And so, let's say this is 0 degrees Celsius. That is 1 degree Celsius, 2 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees Celsius. Now let's say that it's a pretty chilly day, and it's currently 3 degrees Celsius. And someone who predicts the future tells you that it is going to get 4 degrees colder the next day. So how cold will it be? How can you represent that coldness? Well, if it only got 1 degree colder, we would be at 2 degrees. But we know we have to go 4 degrees colder. If we got 2 degrees colder, we would be at 1 degree. If we got 3 degrees colder, we would be at 0. But 3 isn't enough. We have to get 4 degrees colder. So we have to actually go one more below the 0. And that one below 0, we call that negative 1. And so, you can kind of see that the number line, as you go to the right of 0 on the number line, it increases in positive values. As you go to the left of the number line, you're going to have negative 1. Then you're going to have negative 2. And you're going to have negative 3. And you're going to have-- depending on how you think about it-- you're going to have larger negative numbers. But I want to make it very clear-- negative 3 is less than negative 1. There is less heat in the air then negative 1. It is colder. There's less temperature there. So let me just make it very clear. Negative 100 is much smaller than negative 1. You might look at 100, and you might look at 1, and your gut reaction is to say, wow, 100 is a much larger number than 1. But when you think about it, negative 100 means there's a lack of something. If it's negative 100 degrees, there's a lack of heat. So there's much less heat here then if we had negative 1. Let me give you another example. Let's say in my bank account today, I have $10. Let me do this in a new color. So let's say today I have $10. Now let's say I go out there-- because I feel good about my $10-- and let's say I go and spend $30. And for the sake of argument, let's say I have a very flexible bank, one that lets me spend more money than I have-- and these actually exist. So I spend $30. So what's my bank account going to look like? So let me draw a number line here. And you might already have an intuitive response. I will owe the bank some money. So let me write this over here. So tomorrow, what is my bank account? So you might immediately say, look, if I have $10, and I spend $30, there's $20 that had to come from someplace, and that $20 is coming from the bank. So I'm going to owe the bank $20. And so, in my bank account, to sure how much I have, I could say $10 minus $30 is actually negative $20. So in my bank account tomorrow, I'm going to have negative $20. So if I say I have negative $20, that means that I owe the bank. I don't even have it. Not only do I have nothing, I owe something. It's going in reverse. Here, I have something to spend. If my $10 is in my bank, that means the bank owes me $10. I have $10 that I can use to go spend. Now all of a sudden, I owe the bank. I've gone in the other direction. And if we use a number line here, it should hopefully make a little bit of sense. So that is 0. I'm starting off with $10. And spending $30 means I'm moving 30 spaces to the left. So if I move 10 spaces to the left-- if I only spend $10, I'll be back at 0. If I spend another $10, I'll be at negative $10. If I spend another $10 after that, I will be at negative $20. So each of these distances-- I spent $10, I'd be at 0. Another $10, I'd be at negative $10. Another $10, I would be at negative $20. And this whole distance right here is how much I spent. I spent $30. So the general idea, when you spend or if you subtract or if we're getting colder, you would move to the left of the number line. The numbers would get smaller. And we now know they can get smaller than 0. They can go to negative 1, negative 2, they can even go to negative 1.5, negative 1.6. You're getting more and more negative the more you lose. If you're adding-- if I go and get my paycheck, I will move to the right of the number line. Now with that out of the way, let's just do a couple of more pure math problems. And just think about what it means if we were to say 3 minus 4. So once again, this is exactly the situation that we did here with the temperature. We're starting at 3, and we're subtracting 4. So we're going to move 4 to the left. We go 1, 2, 3, 4. So that gets us to negative 1. And when you're starting to do this, you really understand what a negative number means. I really encourage you to visualize the number line, and really move along it depending on whether you're adding and subtracting. Now let's do a couple more. Let's say I have 2 minus 8. And we'll think about more ways to do this in future videos. But once again, you just want to do the number line. You have a 0 here. Let me draw the spacing a little bit. So we have 0 here. We're at 1, 2. If we're subtracting 8, that means we're going to move 8 to the left. So we're going to go 1 to the left, 2 the left. So we've gone 2 to the left to get to 0. We have to move how many more to the left? Well, we've already moved 2 the left. To get to 8, we have to move 6 more to the left. So we're going to have to move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 more to the left. Well, where is that going to put us? Well, we were at 0. This is a negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6. So 2 minus 8 is negative 6. 2 minus 2 would be 0. When you're subtracting 8, you're subtracting another 6. So we'd go up to negative 6. We go 6 below 0. Let me do one more example. And this one will be a little less conventional for you, but hopefully it will make sense. And I'll do this in a new color. Let me take negative 4 minus 2. So we're starting at a negative number, and then we're subtracting from that. And if this seems confusing, just remember the number line. So this is 0 right here. This is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. So that's where we're starting. Now we're going to subtract 2 from negative 4. So we're going to move 2 to the left. So if we subtract 1, we will be at negative 5. If we subtract another 1, we are going to be at negative 6. We are going to be at negative 6. So this is negative 6. Let's do another interesting thing. Let's start at negative 3. Let's say we have negative 3. Instead of subtracting something from that, let's add 2 to it. So where would this put us on the number line? So we're starting at negative 3, and we're adding 2, so we're going to move to the right. So you add 1, you become negative 2. But if you add another 1, which we have to do, you become negative 1. You move 2 to the right. So negative 3 plus negative 2 is negative 1. And you can see for yourself but this all fits our traditional notion of adding and subtracting. If we start at negative 1, and we subtract 2, we should get negative 3-- kind of reverse of this thing up here. Negative 3 plus 2 gets us there. Then if we start then, we subtract 2, we should get back to negative 3, and we see that happens. If you start at negative 1 right over here, and you subtract 2-- you move 2 to the left-- you get back to negative 3. So hopefully, this starts to give you a sense of what it means to deal with, or add and subtract, negative numbers. But we're going to give a lot more examples in the next video. And we're actually going to see what it means to subtract a negative number.",

As we go to the left we get more and more negative. So negative one, negative two, negative three, negative four, and I can keep going on and on and on. Let's pick one of these numbers. Let's say that we pick the number three. What is going to be the opposite of the number three? Well the opposite of the number is a number that's the same distance from zero but on the other side. So three is three to the right of zero. One, two, three. So its opposite is going to be three to the left of zero. One, two, three. So the opposite of three is negative three. Let me make a little table here. If we have the number, the number. And then we have its opposite. We have its opposite. So we just figured out that if you have the number three, its opposite is going to be negative three. Now what if your number is negative? What if your number, let's say the number negative four. What's the opposite of that? And I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it on your own. Well, you say, okay, negative four is right over here. That's negative four. It is four to the left of zero. One, two, three, four to the left of zero. So its opposite is going to be four to the right of it. So one, two, three, four. It's going to be positive. It's going to be positive four. So you're probably starting to see a pattern here. The opposite of a number is going to be the opposite sign of that number. If you have a positive three here, its opposite is going to be negative three. If you start with negative four, its opposite is going to be positive four. One way to think about it, it's going to have the same absolute value but have a different sign.

Or if the number is four to the left of zero, its opposite is going to be four to the right of zero. So we'll do one last one. What is the opposite of... What's going to be the opposite of one? Well one is one to the right of zero, so its opposite is going to be one to the left of zero, or negative one.

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] In another video we've already talked about what an opposite of a number is, but we'll review it a little bit. If we start with a positive number, say, the number four. If you have a number and then we want to think about what the opposite of that number is. Opposite. This is just the symbol for number or shorthand for number. So if the number is four, what is its opposite? Well, four is one, two, three, four to the right of zero. Positive four is four to the right of zero. So its opposite is going to be one, two, three, four to the left. So it's going to be negative four. Or another way to think about it, if you have a positive number, its opposite is going to be the negative of that number. So another way of thinking about it is, is that this negative literally means opposite. One way to think about it, this is the number that is the opposite of four. So let me write this down. So if I write negative four. Negative, let me write this, negative four. That literally means... So you can take this negative symbol as meaning opposite. Opposite. Opposite of four. Opposite of four. If you were to say negative, instead of saying a specific number let's just say a letter that could represent a number. So if I said negative A, that means the opposite of the number A. That means the opposite... Opposite of... Let me do that in blue color. Opposite of A. Of A. And if this confuses you a little bit just look, A could be any number right over here. So let me draw a number line just so this can be a little bit, make a little bit more sense hopefully. So this is a number line. Let me put some tick marks here. I don't know much each of these tick marks jump but let's say that A is some number that is right over here. Well negative A is going to be the opposite of A. So if A is three tick marks to the right negative A is going to be three tick marks to the left. One, two, three. And so the opposite of A is going to be this value right over here. And we can write that, we can write opposite of A over here. We could literally write opposite, opposite of A is that number right over there. Or as a shorthand, we can just write-- We can just write negative. We can just write this is negative A right over here. Negative A. So with that in mind, if we literally view this negative symbol as meaning the opposite of whatever this is, let's try something interesting. What would be the negative-- Let me do this in another color. What would be the negative of negative three? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Well we just said, this negative means the opposite. So you can think about this as meaning this means the opposite... Opposite of negative-- The opposite of negative three. So what is the opposite of negative three? Well negative three is three to the left of zero. One, two, three. So it's opposite is going to be three to the right of zero. One, two, three. So it's going to be positive three. So this is equal to positive three. Or we could just write positive three like that. So hopefully this gives you a better appreciation for what opposite means and also how it relates to the actual negative symbol. We could keep going. We could do something like what is the negative of the negative of negative-- Let me do a different number. Of negative two. Well, this part right over here the negative, the opposite of negative two, which is really the opposite of the opposite of two, well that's just going to be two. Every time you say opposite you flip over the number line. So this flips you over the number line two to the left and this flips you back two to the right so all of this is going to be two but then you're going to take the opposite of two so that's just going to be negative two. If you threw another negative in front of this, it would be the opposite of all of this. So it would be the opposite of negative two and then all of a sudden it would become positive. So every time you put that negative in front there you're flipping on the other side of the number line.",

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] So we have a number line here with zero at the center and then on that number line we've marked off some numbers. So, to the left of the number line we have the number a, and then we have the number b here, a little bit closer to zero, and then on the right side of zero we have the number c. And then after that, we have a bunch of statements dealing with inequalities. Now, what I want you to do is pause the video and think about which of these statements are true, which of these statements are false, and maybe which of these statements you don't have enough information to figure out. So, I'm assuming you've had a go at it. You've tried to figure out which of these are true, which of these are false, and which of these you can't figure out. So, let's do them together. So, this first statement says negative b is less than negative c. So, we do know for a fact that b is less than c. We know that b is less than c. How do we know that? Well, b is to the left of c on the number line. It's that straight forward. So, we know this. This is definitely true. But what about negative b? Is negative b less than negative c? So, let's think about where negative b is on this number line. So, negative b I will do in yellow. So, negative, negative b means the opposite of b. So if b is one hash mark to the left of zero, negative b is going to be one hash mark to the right of zero. So, that right over there, is going to be negative b. And now, where is negative c? Once again, negative c, this literally means the opposite of c. C is one, two, three, four, five hash marks to the right of zero. And so negative c is going to be one, two, three, four, five hash marks to the left of zero. And actually, let me do this in a different color. So, negative c I will do in purple. This right over here is negative c. So, let's compare, is negative b less than negative c? No, negative b is to the right of negative c on the number line. Negative b is greater than negative c. So, this is not true. Negative b is to the right of negative c. Negative b is greater than negative c. And if this is a little confusing, just think about it. Since b is a negative number, negative b is going to be a positive number. And since c is a positive number, negative c is going to be a negative number. So, it makes complete sense that a positive number is going to be greater than a negative number. And you see it here, negative b is to the right of negative c on the number line. So, we can rule this one out. So the next question, is negative b greater than zero? Well, we already plotted negative b, it's going to be one to the right, or one hash mark to the right, we don't know how much each of these hash marks represent, but it's going to be to the right of zero. So, it is greater than zero. This is true. That is true. All right, now is a greater than b? Well, let's look at it. A is to the left of b on the number line. A is more negative than b. So, a is less than b, not greater than b. So, this is not going to be the case. In order for something to be greater than something else, it would have to be to the right of it. For a to the greater than b, it would have to be to the right of b. But we see, a is to the left of b. A is less than b. All right, one more to think about. Negative a is greater than c. So, we know that a isn't greater than c, a is to the left of c. A is a negative number, it's to the left of zero, c is a positive number, it's to the right of zero. But what about negative a? Well, let's draw that. Let me do this in a color that I haven't used yet. Negative a, where would that be? Well a is one, two, three, four, five, six hash marks to the left of zero. And so negative a is going to be six hash marks to the right of zero. So, let's count that. One, two, three, four, five, six. So, negative a is going to be right over there. And notice, negative a is to the right of c, so negative a is greater than c. This is true. And if you get confused, if you say, wait, this looks like a negative, how can it be larger than a positive? Remember, negative a itself is a negative number. And a itself is six hash marks to the left. So if you take the opposite of that, you're going to get a positive number. You're going to get six hash marks to the right. And c, which was already a positive number, is only five hash marks to the right. And so, negative a, this is going to be a positive number, and it's going to be greater than c. It's to the right of c.",

        "transcript": "Let's have some practice adding and subtracting negative numbers. So the first example I want to look at is 2 minus 3. So right now I'm just subtracting a positive number from another positive number, but you might already see that I'm subtracting a larger number from a smaller number. So I'm probably, or I will, definitely end up with a negative number. But let's just think about this a little bit. And I'm going to do it with a number line. So there's my number line right over there. Now this is 0, this is 1, this is 2, this is negative 1, this is negative 2. We could view this as starting at 2. So this is 2 right over here, and then we're going to subtract 3 from that 2. So we're going to move 3 to the left on the number line. So we're going to move 3 to the left, 1, 2, 3. And that gets us to negative 1. This is equal to negative 1. Now let's mix it up a little bit more. Let's imagine what would happen if we had negative 2 minus 3. So this was positive 2 minus 3. Now let's think about negative 2 minus 3. So once again, let's draw our number line. And I'll put 0 over here. So this is 0, this is 1, this is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, and I could keep going. But we're starting at negative 2, and then we're subtracting 3 again. So once again, we're going to move three to the left of negative 2. So we go 1, 2, 3. We end up at negative 5. So this is negative 5. So notice in both situations we subtracted 3, we moved 3 to the left on the number line. It's just here we started 2 to the right of 0. Here we started 2 to the left of 0. This is negative 2. Let's do another example with these same numbers. Let's imagine negative 2 plus 3. I encourage you to pause this video, and try to think about this on your own. So we could draw the number line-- I could draw a straighter number line than that-- so draw the number line again. And let's say that this is negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, and 2 again. We're starting at negative 2, we're starting 2 to the left of zero. So we're starting at negative 2, and we're going to add 3. So we're going to go 3 to the right now, 1, 2, 3, and we end up at positive 1. Now let's think about 2, so positive 2, and we're going to subtract a negative 3. And other videos we've already talked about this. In fact, there's a video explaining why this actually makes sense. But when you subtract a negative, this is the same thing as adding the positive. So 2 minus negative 3 is the exact same thing as 2 plus 2 plus positive 3. These two statements are equivalent, and this just boils down to, this right over here, is just going to be 5. Now, let's mix it up a little bit more. Let's imagine negative 2 minus negative 3. Now, this might seem really intimidating to have all of these negatives in place here, but you just have to remember subtracting a negative, like this, is going to get you a positive. So this is the exact same thing as negative 2 plus 3, and negative 2 plus 3, we've already seen it right over here. You start at negative 2, you start 2 to the left of 0, and then we're going to go 3 to the right, we're adding 3, 1, 2, 3.",

        "transcript": "Find the sum 15 plus negative 46 plus 29. Let's just think about this first part over here where we have 15 plus negative 46. And we'll worry about the plus 29 later on. So let's just do 15-- let me do that in a different color-- plus negative 46. I'll do it in that orange. Let me draw a number line here, just so we can properly visualize what is going on. That's my number line. And we're starting at 15. So let's draw a 0 over here. And so we're starting at 15. 15 could be right over here. So this is 15. Let me draw a big fat arrow to signify this is 15. 15 has an absolute value of 15, so the length of this arrow would be 15. Now we're adding negative 46 to that 15. This is equivalent to 15 minus 46, which means we are going to move 46 spots to the left of 15. A negative sign or a minus means we're moving to the left on the number line. So we're going to move 46 to the left. We're starting at 15, and we are going to move 46 to the left. So the length of this arrow right here is going to be 46, and we're moving to the left. This is the negative 46 that we're adding to the 15. We're going to end up at some point over here. That point is clearly 0. Because we were 15 to the right. Now we're going to move 46 to the left. So we're definitely going to be to the left of 0. It's definitely going to be a negative number. And we can even think about the absolute value of that negative number. We can just visualize it. This yellow arrow has a length of 15. This orange arrow has a length of 46. The blue arrow that I'm about to draw, which is the sum of these two, is going to have this length right over here. And just visually, how can we figure out the length of this blue part if we know the length of this orange part and we know the length of this yellow part? Well, it's just going to be the difference. It's just going to be the difference of these two. So the absolute value of the sum is going to be the difference between this length, 46, and 15. Let me just figure that out, 46 minus 15. 6 minus 5 is 1. 4 minus 1 is 3. So the length of this is going to be 31, and it's going to be 31 to the left of 0. So this is going to be negative 31 right over here. We know that this first part over here is negative 31, and then to that we are going to add 29. So we're going to add 29. Let me do that in another color. What does that mean? That means that we're going to start at negative 31, and we're going to move 29 to the right. We're adding 29, so we're going to move 29 to the right. So maybe that gets us right about there. I'm trying to draw an arrow of length 29. I can draw a cleaner looking arrow than that. I'll do it right over here, actually. So then we're going to move 29 over to the right. That's the 29 part. Now this is a positive 29, and so how do we figure out what this is? This is 29 right here that we're adding. This is going to land us right over here on the number line. So how do we figure out what number that is? Well, once again, we can just visualize it. And eventually you won't have to draw number lines and stuff, but I think it'll be useful here. We're starting at negative 31. We're adding 29 to it, so it's going to make it less negative. But we're still adding less than 31, so we're not going to get all the way back to 0. We're still going to have a negative number. But how could we figure out the absolute value of that negative number, its distance? Well, once again, that little white part right there, that white part plus this 29, is going to equal 31, if you just think of absolute value, if we don't think about the signs, if we just think about the length. Or another way to think about it, 31 minus 29 will give us the length of that white part. And of course, it's going to be negative, because the negative number here is larger than the positive number. And we're adding the 2. If we do 31 minus 29, you could borrow and all of that, but that's clearly just going to be equal to 2. You could say that's 11. This is a 2. You subtract, this is equal to 2. But since it's negative 31 plus 29, it's going to be a negative 2. We're still going to stay negative. We haven't moved far to the right enough to pass 0. So this right here is going to be negative 2. Or another way to think about it, the length of this white bar, the absolute value, is going to be 2. 2 plus 29 is 31. But we're operating to the left of 0, so it's negative 31. This is negative 2. Anyway, hopefully you found that useful. And let me make it clear. Our final answer is negative 2.",

If you are using a number line to help you, when you see a negative sign for a number, that means you are going back the same number of hops that the number is on the number line. You do the reverse for a positive number. I'm also going to go through another example. If you had the problem -91+93, here is how you would solve it. On a number line, 91 is 91 hops to the left of 0. 93 hops is 93 hops to the right of zero. When adding negative and positive numbers, you always want to stay close to the number 0. The difference between the numbers 91 and 93 is two. When you add +93 to -91, you can easily get to 0 by changing the 93 to a 91. -91+91 is 0. To get back to 93 from 91, you have 2 left over. You are allready at 0 from your fake number line. 0+2=2, so -91+93=2.\nHope this helps 245138!"

Like this < 0 - - - - 1 - - - - 2 - - - - 3 >. Then we can cut up each space between each whole into five equal parts. Each part is 1/5 of each one whole. If we count up the fifths, up to fifteen fifths or 15/5, we get up to 3 on the line. This makes sense if you think about fifteen fifths, or 15/5 being 15 divided by 5, which is of course 3. Or as having 15 slices of pie. If 5 slices make one pie, then 15 slices is enough to put together 3 whole pies."

Well, the same thing applies here, 1/2 is essentially the same thing as 2/4. So on a number line that\u2019s only cut up into 19 pieces, you could cut the 19 pieces even further and make it 38 pieces, 2 times bigger than 19. The number line doesn\u2019t add any extra integers, just detailing it a bit more.\nBut I know your question is asking something slightly different so in order to find 7/36 in 19/19 or 1, you would get rid of the 19/19 number line and draw a number line that is divided into 36 pieces. Hope this answered your question!"

I can move this dot right over here, but I encourage you, pause the video, and put your finger on where 7/6 would be on the number line. All right, now let's work on this together. So what they're saying is, is from zero to this point on the number line right over there, that gets us to 1/6. So each of these spaces are a sixth. So we go zero, 1/6, 2/6, 3/6, 4/6, 5/6, 6/6, 7/6. Let me make sure I got that. So each of these are a sixth. So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, 7/6. So that's 7/6 on that number line. Now they have other ways of getting at the same idea. For example, they say which point is at 9/4 on the number line? And they ask us to choose one answer, and we can look at the choices here. So which choice shows 9/4 on the number line? Pause this video and see if you can pick that. All right, now let's look at each of these. So it looks like in choice, in this first choice, the space between zero and one is split into one, two, three, four equal spaces. So as we go from zero to this next line, that's a fourth. And that seems like it keeps going. So this is 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 8/4, 9/4 is here. That's what we're looking for. But the dot is not at 9/4. It's at 10/4, 11/4, it's at 12/4. So I don't like choice A. Let's see, choice B. Let's see what is, let's see, we have divided the space between zero and one into one, two, three, four, five, six equal spaces. So each of these are a sixth. So to go from zero to one, you've already gone 6/6, and then 7/6, 8/6, 9/6. So this is 9/6, not 9/4. And so let's look at this last choice. I'm already feeling like it should be the answer, but. We can see that the spaces are the same as in our first choice, so these are each fourths. Once again I know that because the space between zero and one or any two whole numbers is divided into four equal spaces. So to go from zero to one, you go 4/4, and then 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 8/4, and 9/4. So choice C is definitely looking good. Let's do one more example. So here they say, what fraction is located at Point A on the number line? Pause this video and see if you can answer that. All right. So between the whole numbers, how many spaces, equal spaces, do we have? It looks like we have one, two, three, four, five, six equal spaces. So things are divided into sixths. So 1/6, 2/6, 3/6, 4/6, 5/6, 6/6, which is equal to one, and then 7/6. So this is seven over six, just like that, and we are done.",

        },
        "transcript": "Write 5 and 1/4 as an improper fraction. An improper fraction is just a pure fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator. This right here, it's not a pure fraction. We have a whole number mixed with a fraction, so we call this a mixed number. So let's think about what 5 and 1/4 represents, and let me rewrite it. So if we're talking about 5 and 1/4, and you can literally think of this as 5 and 1/4 or 5 plus 1/4, that's what 5 and 1/4 represents. So let's think about 5. Five is 5 wholes, or if you're thinking of pie, we could draw literally five pies. Let me just cut up the pies from the get go into four pieces since we're dealing with fourths. So let me just cut up the pies right over here. So that's one pie right over there. Let me copy and paste this. Copy and paste. So I have two pies, and then I have three pies, and then I have four pies, and then I have five pies. So this is what the 5 represents. 5 literally represents-- so let me circle all of this together. That is the 5 part right there. That is what 5 literally represents. It represents five whole pies. Now, I have cut up the pies into four pieces, so you can imagine each piece represents a fourth. Now, how many pieces do I have in these five pies? Well, I have four pieces per pie. Let me just right it here. 4 pieces per pie times 5 pies is equal to 20 pieces. Or another way to think of it, since each piece is a fourth, this is also equal to 20 times 1/4, or you could just write this as being equal to 20/4. So we have 5 whole pies is equal to 20 fourths. Let me write it like that. 20 fourths. Or we could write it as 20/4. I've kind of done the same thing twice. So that's what the five pies represent. 20/4 or 20 pieces, where each piece is 1/4. Now, the 1/4 right here represents literally one more fourth of a pie or one more piece of a pie, so let me draw another pie here. So that is another pie. Cut it into four pieces. But this 1/4 only represents one of these pieces, right? This is one of the four pieces. The denominator tells us how many pieces. The 1 tells us how many of those pieces we're dealing with, so it's just this one piece over here. That right there is the 1/4. Now, if we write 5 and 1/4, we just saw that the 5 right here is 20/4. So we could rewrite this. Let me write it like this. 5 and 1/4 can be rewritten as the same thing as 5 plus 1/4, which is the same thing as-- we just saw that five whole pies is the same thing as 20/4. And to see that these are the same thing, you literally just divide 4 into 20. You get 5, and nothing is left over. So 5 is the same thing as 20/4, and then this plus 1/4 is the same thing as plus 1/4. So if I have 20 fourths and I add one more fourth to it, how many fourths do I have? Well, I have 21. I have 21 fourths. Or another way of thinking about it, this 5 is-- so this right here is 20 pieces of pie. You can even count it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. But a quicker way is to say, well, we have five pies. Each of them have four pieces. 5 times 4 is 20. This 1/4 right here represents one piece plus one piece, so total we're going to have 21 pieces. So we have 21 pieces, where each piece is 1/4, so we could say we have 21 times 1/4 or 21 fourths pieces of pie. However you want to think of it, but we've solved the problem. We're at an improper fraction. We've written 5 and 1/4 as an improper fraction. Now, I've gone through great pains to give you the intuition of what 5 and 1/4 means, but there is a fairly straightforward process for getting straight to the improper fraction. Let me color code it. So if you have 5 and 1 over 4, to convert it into an improper fraction, you're going to keep the same denominator, so you're going to have the over 4 there. But your numerator is going to be your numerator of the fraction part before. So it's going to be 1 plus your whole number times your denominator. So 1 plus-- or actually, let me do it the way I tend to think of it. What I do is I take 4 times 5. So let me write that down and I want to color code it. 4 times 5, and then to that, I add this numerator. So I literally do 4 times 5 plus 1, which is-- so this is equal to 4 times 5 is 20, plus 1 is 21, and then that's over 4, so it's 21/4. And all of this is kind of a fast way to do it. We're literally doing the exact same thing that we did here in kind of a slower way. We're saying, OK, 5 wholes is the same thing as 20 fourths, so you take 5, and I figure that out, 5 times 4, and then I have one more fourth there, so 4 times 5 plus 1 gives 21.",

Then you will want to add it to the one because it you can't forget the half that was already there. Then you end up with the answer- 7/2\nThis also works with bigger numbers as well.\n\nHope this helps,\nShiloh"

So first I'm just going to show you a fairly straightforward way of doing it and then we're going to think a little bit about what it actually means. So to figure out what 7/4 represents as a mixed number, let me write it in different colors. So this is going to be equal to-- the easiest way I do it is you say, well, you divide 4 it 7. If we're dealing with fourths, 4 goes into 7 a total of one time. Let me do this in another color. 1 times 4 is 4. And then what is our remainder? 7 minus 4 is 3. So if we wanted to write this in plain-- well, let me just do the problem, and then we'll think about what it means in a second. So you see that 4 goes into 7 one time, so you have one whole here, and then how much do you have left over? Well, you have 3 left over, and that comes from right over there. That is the remainder when you divide 4 into 7. 3 left over, but it's 3 of your 4, or 3/4 left over. So that's the way we just converted it from an improper fraction to a mixed number. Now, it might seem a little bit like voodoo what I just did. I divided 4 into 7, it goes one time, and then the remainder is 3, so I got 1 and 3/4. But why does that make sense? Why does that actually makes sense? So let's draw fourths. Let's draw literally 7 fourths and maybe it'll become clear. So let's do a little square as a fourth. So let's say I have a square like that, and that is 1/4. Now, let's think about what seven of those mean, so let me copy and paste that. Copy and then paste it. So here I have 2 one-fourths, or you could see I have 2/4. Now I have 3 one-fourths. Now, I have 4 one-fourths. Now this is a whole, right? I have 4 one-fourths. This is a whole. So let me start on another whole. So now I have 5. Now I have 6 one-fourths, and now I have 7 one-fourths. Now, what does this look like? So all I did is I rewrote 7/4, or 7 one-fourths. I just kind of drew it for you. Now, what does this represent? Well, I have 4 fourths here, so this is 4/4. This right here is 3/4. Notice, 7/4 is 4/4 with 3/4 left over. So let me write it this way. 7/4 is 4/4 with 3/4 left over. Now what is 4/4? 4/4 is one whole. So you have one whole with 3/4 left over, so you end up with 1 and 3/4. So that is the 3/4 part and that is your one whole. Hopefully that makes sense and hopefully you understand why it connects. Because you say, well, how many wholes do you have? When you're dividing the 4 into the 7 and getting the one, you're essentially saying how many wholes? So the number of wholes, or you can imagine, the number of whole pies. And then how many pieces do we have left over? Well, we have 3 pieces and each piece is 1/4, so we have 3/4 left over. So we have one whole pie and three pieces, which are each a fourth left over.",

        "transcript": "So I've got a whole pizza here, and let's say that I were to cut it into two equal pieces. Let me cut it right over here into 2 equal pieces. And let's say that I ate one of those 2 equal pieces. So let's say I ate all of this right over here. What fraction of the pizza have I eaten? Well, I took the whole and I divide it into two equal pieces, and then I ate one of those pieces. So I ate 1/2 of the pizza. Now, let's imagine that instead of cutting that pizza into only 2 equal pieces, let's imagine instead that decide to cut it into 4 equal pieces. So let's draw that. So 4 equal pieces. So I could cut once this way and then I could cut it once this way. And so here I have 4 equal pieces. But let's say that I want to eat the same amount of pizza. How many of these 4 equal pieces would I have to eat. I encourage you to pause the video and think about that. Well, I would eat this piece. You could imagine me eating this piece and this piece right over here. I've eaten the same amount of the pizza. Each of these pieces you could imagine got cut into 2 pieces when I cut the whole pizza this way. And so now I have to eat 2 slices of the 4, as opposed to 1 slice of the 2. So I just ate 2 out of the 4 slices. I'm using different numbers here. Here I'm using a 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator. Here, I'm using a 2 in the numerator and a 4 in the denominator. These two fractions represent the same quantity. I ate the same amount of pizza. If I eat 2/4 of a pizza, if I eat 2 out of 4 equal pieces, that's the same fraction of the pizza as if I eat 1 out of 2 equal pieces. So we would say that these two things are equivalent fractions. Now let's do another one like this. Instead of just dividing it into 4 equal pieces, let's divide it into 8 equal pieces. So now we could cut once like this. So now we have 2 equal pieces. Cut once like this. Now we have 4 equal pieces. And then divide each of those 4 pieces into 2 pieces. So I'll cut those in-- So let's see. I want to make them equal pieces. Those don't look as equal as I would like. So that looks more equal, and that looks reasonably equal. So now how many equal pieces do I have? I have 8 equal pieces. But let's say I wanted to eat the same fraction of the pizza. So I could eat all of these pieces right over here. Well, how many of those 8 equal pieces have I eaten? Well, I've eaten 1, 2, 3, 4 of those 8 equal pieces. And so once again, this fraction, 4 of 8, or 4/8, is equivalent to 2/4, which is equivalent to 1/2. And you might see a little bit of a pattern here. Going from this scenario to this scenario, I got twice as many equal slices. Because I had twice as many equal slices, I needed to eat two times the number of slices. So I multiply the denominator by 2, and I multiply the numerator by 2. If I multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, then I'm not changing what that fraction represents. And you see that over here. Going from 4 slices to 8 slices, I cut every slice, I turned every slice into 2 more slices, so I had twice as many slices. And then if I want to eat the same amount, I have to eat twice as many pieces. So all of these, 1/2, 2/4, four 4/8, and I could keep going. I could do 8/16. I could do 16/32.

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] If I were to give you the fraction 1/3, I could rewrite it. If I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by two, one times two is two, and three times two is six. So we know that 1/3 is the same thing as 2/6. This is true, 1/3 is just another way of saying 2/6. Now given that we know that, which of these, I guess you could say, picture equations actually show us that that is true? Show that to us visually? We could start with this first one. We have three equal sections, so each of these sections are 1/3. And we have one of those 1/3 shaded in. If we go on the right side, we have six equal sections, so it's divided into 1/6, and we have two of them shaded in. One, two. And the important thing to realize, is over here, we divided the same rectangle to the 1/3 as we divided into 1/6 over here. We are comparing fractions of the same whole. So you see that if you were to take these two magenta boxes and put them together, they actually do have the same area as this one larger rectangle. So this one looks like a good picture explanation or a visual explanation for why 1/3 is equal to 2/6. You take the same rectangle, divide it into 1/3 and take one of them, and then you take that same exact rectangle, divide it into 1/6 and pick two of them, you have shaded in the same amount. 1/3 over here is the same thing as 2/6 over here. The important thing to realize is that you're taking 1/3 and 2/6 of the exact same rectangle. When you look over at these figures, you see that this is 1/3 of this figure right over here. It's split into three equal sections, and this is one of them that's shaded in. And this is, right over here, 2/6. You have six equal sections and we've shaded in two of them. And we know that 1/3 is equal to 2/6, but this picture isn't true. This shaded area right over here is less than this shaded area over here. So you say, \"Why doesn't it work? \"Why isn't this 1/3 the same thing as 2/6?\" Because you're taking 2/6 of a larger hexagon here. Here, you're taking 1/3 of a smaller figure. Here, you're taking 2/6 of a larger figure. You can't compare fractions of different wholes. 2/6 of a larger whole is going to be larger than 1/3 of a smaller whole. The only time that 1/3 and 2/6 are going to be equivalent is if they are of the same whole, like we saw up here. So this is not true. And for the same reason, this right over here is 1/3 and this over here is 2/6. This is 1/3 of a smaller circle than this 2/6 is. So this is not true. By that same logic, we have these other pictures over here. And over here, we're not talking about 1/3 and 2/6. Here, we're talking about, let's see, splitting something into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So we're talking about 1/8, and in this case, it's one, two, three, four, five, six, 6/8, and we're comparing it, let's see over here, they're dividing into four and they've shaded in three. Now it is true that 6/8 is equal to 3/4. Six divided by two is three. Eight divided by two is four. So if you multiply or divide the numerator by the exact same thing, then you're going to get an equivalent fraction. Now 6/8 is equal to 3/4, but this picture isn't true because 6/8 would be equal to 3/4 if you're talking about taking 6/8 and 3/4 of the same size, in this case, diamond. These things are not the same size, so you can't make this picture statement. Same thing for this one over here. These circles are of different sizes. So taking the same fraction of different sizes, you can't say that they're going to be equal. This last one, you're taking the fractions of the same whole. It's kind of this weird left-pointing arrow-looking shape, but they are the same shape. And you see here, we've divided that shape into 1/8, and we have shaded in six of them. One, two, let me do that in a yellow so you can see it. One, two, three, four, five, six. Over here, we have divided it into 1/4, and we have shaded in three of them. So this statement is true. We already knew that 6/8 and 3/4 are the same thing, but this picture right over here visually shows us that, because we're taking 6/8 of the same whole as we're taking 3/4 of it, and you see that here. This area, let me shade it in a different color. So the area that I'm shading in, six of these triangles with equal area is the same thing as three of these parallelograms, or three of the four. These have the same area, you could see that. One of these, like that one right over there, could be equivalent to this over here, equivalent to that over there. Actually, let me do that for all of them. This one over here could be equivalent to, let's see, if you were to flip it over, it would be equivalent to that over there. And finally, I think you see where this is going, this one over here is equivalent to this one over here. So we have the same fraction shaded in. We just divided the one on the left into more equal pieces than we did on the right but these are equivalent fractions. And this picture shows us that 6/8 is, indeed, equal to 3/4. Once again, 6/8 of the same whole is equal to 3/4 of that same whole.",

        "transcript": "Let's compare the fraction 4/7 to the fraction 5/7. And what I want you to do right now is to pause this video and think about which of these fractions represents a larger quantity. I'm assuming you've had a go at it, and the one thing that might jump out at you is that they both have the same bottom number, which we call the denominator. They both have a denominator of 7. So one way to think about it is this is literally 4 sevenths. This is literally 5 sevenths. So we could rewrite 4/7 as literally 4 times 1/7. And we can rewrite 5/7 as literally 5 times 1/7. It's 5/7. So now if I have 4 of something versus 5 of something, which is going to be a larger quantity? Well, clearly 5 of this 1/7 is going to be more. So 4/7 is smaller, 5/7 is larger. And so what we can do is we can write a less than symbol. The way that I remember less than and greater than, is that the point, the small side of the symbol, always is on the same side as the smaller number. So this could be read as 4/7 is less than 5/7, or that 4 times 1/7 is less than 5 times 1/7. Now, let's do another scenario, but instead of having the same denominator, let's have the same numerator. So let's say we want to compare 3/4 versus-- let's say versus 3/9. Which of these two fractions is a larger number? And once again, pause the video and try to think about it on your own. Well, as we mentioned, we don't have the same denominator here. We have the same top number instead. Here is the same bottom number, same denominator. Here we're going to have the same numerator. We have the 3 right over there. And we could view 3/4 as literally 3 times 1/4. And we could view 3/9 as literally 3 times 1/9. So we have 3/4 and we have 3/9. So we really just have to about what's larger, a fourth or a ninth? Well, think about if you start with a whole-- think about starting with a whole like this. And let me make a whole right over here, so the same sized whole. A fourth is literally taking the whole and dividing it into 4 pieces. While a ninth is taking the whole and dividing it into 9. 9 equal sections, I could say. So let's divide this into 4 equal sections. So my best attempt to hand draw equal sections. So that's 2 equal sections and then that looks pretty close to 4 equal sections. So that right over there is 1/4. And let me draw ninths here. So let me first split this into 3 equal sections. So those would be third. And then split each of those into 3 equal sections. So this is my best attempt at that, at hand drawing 9 equal sections, splitting the whole into 9 equal sections. So when you see here-- and you might have already realized this-- if you divide something into 4 equal sections, each section is going to be bigger than if you divide it into 9 equal sections. A ninth is smaller than a fourth. A ninth is smaller than 1/4. So 3/9 is going to be smaller than 3/4. So once again, when you want to do less than or greater than, you want to put the point, the small side of the symbol, on the same side as the smaller number. So it would look like this. And this is the greater than symbol, because what you have on the left is the larger number. 3/4 is greater than 3/9. And if you actually wanted to represent not just 1/4 and 1/9, we could actually color it in. 3 times one fourth, well that's 1, 2, 3. While 3 times 1/9, or 3/9, is 1, 2, 3. And when you look at it that way, it's pretty clear. But the important thing to realize is, is that when the denominator is larger, you're dividing the whole into more pieces so each piece will be smaller. So making the denominator larger makes the fraction smaller. Making the numerator larger makes the fraction larger.",

        "transcript": "Use less than, greater than, or equal to compare the two fractions 21/28, or 21 over 28, and 6/9, or 6 over 9. So there's a bunch of ways to do this. The easiest way is if they had the same denominator, you could just compare the numerators. Unlucky for us, we do not have the same denominator. So what we could do is we can find a common denominator for both of them and convert both of these fractions to have the same denominator and then compare the numerators. Or even more simply, we could simplify them first and then try to do it. So let me do that last one, because I have a feeling that'll be the fastest way to do it. So 21/28-- you can see that they are both divisible by 7. So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 7. So we could divide 21 by 7. And we can divide-- so let me make the numerator-- and we can divide the denominator by 7. We're doing the same thing to the numerator and the denominator, so we're not going to change the value of the fraction. So 21 divided by 7 is 3, and 28 divided by 7 is 4. So 21/28 is the exact same fraction as 3/4. 3/4 is the simplified version of it. Let's do the same thing for 6/9. 6 and 9 are both divisible by 3. So let's divide them both by 3 so we can simplify this fraction. So let's divide both of them by 3. 6 divided by 3 is 2, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So 21/28 is 3/4. They're the exact same fraction, just written a different way. This is the more simplified version. And 6/9 is the exact same fraction as 2/3. So we really can compare 3/4 and 2/3. So this is really comparing 3/4 and 2/3. And the real benefit of doing this is now this is much easier to find a common denominator for than 28 and 9. Then we would have to multiply big numbers. Here we could do fairly small numbers. The common denominator of 3/4 and 2/3 is going to be the least common multiple of 4 and 3. And 4 and 3 don't share any prime factors with each other. So their least common multiple is really just going to be the product of the two. So we can write 3/4 as something over 12. And we can write 2/3 as something over 12. And I got the 12 by multiplying 3 times 4. They have no common factors. Another way you could think about it is 4, if you do a prime factorization, is 2 times 2. And 3-- it's already a prime number, so you can't prime factorize it any more. So what you want to do is think of a number that has all of the prime factors of 4 and 3. So it needs one 2, another 2, and a 3. Well, 2 times 2 times 3 is 12. And either way you think about it, that's how you would get the least common multiple or the common denominator for 4 and 3. Well, to get from 4 to 12, you've got to multiply by 3. So we're multiplying the denominator by 3 to get to 12. So we also have to multiply the numerator by 3. So 3 times 3 is 9. Over here, to get from 3 to 12, we have to multiply the denominator by 4. So we also have to multiply the numerator by 4. So we get 8. And so now when we compare the fractions, it's pretty straightforward. 21/28 is the exact same thing as 9/12, and 6/9 is the exact same thing as 8/12. So which of these is a greater quantity? Well, clearly, we have the same denominator right now. We have 9/12 is clearly greater than 8/12. So 9/12 is clearly greater than 8/12. Or if you go back and you realize that 9/12 is the exact same thing as 21/28, we could say 21/28 is definitely greater than-- and 8/12 is the same thing as 6/9-- is definitely greater than 6/9. And we are done. Another way we could have done it-- we didn't necessarily have to simplify that. And let me show you that just for fun. So if we were doing it with-- if we didn't think to simplify our two numbers first. I'm trying to find a color I haven't used yet. So 21/28 and 6/9. So we could just find a least common multiple in the traditional way without simplifying first. So what's the prime factorization of 28? It's 2 times 14. And 14 is 2 times 7. That's its prime factorization. Prime factorization of 9 is 3 times 3. So the least common multiple of 28 and 9 have to contain a 2, a 2, a 7, a 3 and a 3. Or essentially, it's going to be 28 times 9. So let's over here multiply 28 times 9. There's a couple of ways you could do it. You could multiply in your head 28 times 10, which would be 280, and then subtract 28 from that, which would be what? 252. Or we could just multiply it out if that confuses you. So let's just do the second way. 9 times 8 is 72. 9 times 2 is 18. 18 plus 7 is 25. So we get 252. So I'm saying the common denominator here is going to be 252. Least common multiple of 28 and 9. Well, to go from 28 to 252, we had to multiply it by 9. We had to multiply 28 times 9. So we're multiplying 28 times 9. So we also have to multiply the numerator times 9. So what is 21 times 9? That's easier to do in your head. 20 times 9 is 180. And then 1 times 9 is 9. So this is going to be 189. To go from 9 to 252, we had to multiply by 28. So we also have to multiply the numerator by 28 if we don't want to change the value of the fraction. So 6 times 28-- 6 times 20 is 120. 6 times 8 is 48. So we get 168. Let me write that out just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 28 times 6-- 8 times 6 is 48. 2 times 6 is 12, plus 4 is 16. So right, 168. So now we have a common denominator here. And so we can really just compare the numerators. And 189 is clearly greater than 168. So 189/252 is clearly greater than 168/252. Or that's the same thing as saying 21/28, because that's what this is over here. The left-hand side is 21/28, is clearly greater than the right-hand side, which is really 6/9.",

        },
        "transcript": "So we're asked to add 3/15 plus 7/15, and then simplify the answer. So just the process when you add fractions is if they already-- well, first of all, if they're not mixed numbers, and neither of these are, and if they have the same denominator. In this example, the denominators are already the same. The denominator is 15. So if you add these two fractions, your sum is going to have the same denominator, 15, and your numerator is just going to be the sum of the numerator, so it's going to be 3 plus 7, or it's going to be equal to 10/15. Now, if we wanted to simplify this, we'd look for the greatest common factor in both the 10 and the 15, and as far as I can tell, 5 is the largest number that goes into both of them. So divide the 10 by 5 and you divide the 15 by 5, and you get-- 10 divided by 5 is 2 and 15 divided by 5 is 3. You get 2/3. Now, to understand why this works, let's draw it out. Let's split something up into 15 sections. So let me split it up into 15 sections. Let me see how well I can do this. Well, actually, even a better way, an easier way might be to draw circles. So let me do the 15 sections. So let me draw. So that is one section right over there. That is one section and then if I copy and paste it, that is a second section, and then a third section, fourth section, and then we have a fifth section. Let me copy and paste this whole thing. So that's five sections right there. Let me copy and then paste that. So that is 10 sections, and then let me do it one more time. So that is 15 sections. So you can imagine this whole thing is like a candy bar or something, and we have now split it up into 15 sections. Now, what is 3/15? Well, it's going to be 3 of the 15 sections. So 3/15 is going to be one, two, three: 3/15. Now, to that, were adding 7 of the 1/15 sections, or 7 of the sections. So we're adding 7 of those to it. So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And you see now, if you take the orange and the blue, you get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten of the sections, or 10 of the 15 sections. And then to see why this is the same thing as 2/3, you can just split this candy bar into thirds, so each third would have five sections in it. So let's do that. One, two, three, four, five, so that is 1/3 right there. One, two, three, four, five, that is another third right there. And notice, when you do it like this, we have filled out exactly two-- one, two-- of the thirds. This is the third third, but that's not filled in. So 10/15 is the same thing as 2/3.",

                "a": "Yes, GCD means Greatest Common Divisor. Another way to think of it is the Greatest Common Factor. When comparing 2 or more numbers, the GCD/GCF is the LARGEST (i.e. greatest) factor that they both share. For example, 12 and 16. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and the factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. If you look at both lists, you'll notice that both share the numbers 1, 2 and 4 but the largest of these shared COMMON factors is 4 so the GCD or GCF is 4. You'll notice that this is smaller than both 12 and 16.\n\nLCM is the Lowest/Least Common Multiple. MULTIPLES on the other hand are larger or equal to the numbers you are comparing. Take 3 and 8. The multiples of 3 is just the 3 times table (3, 6, 9, 12, etc.) and the multiples of 8 are the 8 times table (8, 16, 24, 32, and so on). If you continued each table you would eventually find that each table shares some numbers. The SMALLEST (i.e. least/lowest) of these that are shared is the LCM. In this case, continuing 3's multiples: 15, 18, 21, 24, 27... etc. You can see that 8 and 3 can both multiply to 24. So the LCM is 24. Using the previous example of 12 and 16, the LCM is 48 since 12 x 4 = 48 and 16 x 3 = 48."

        },
        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] Let's say that we have the fraction 9/10, and I want to add to that the fraction 1/6. What is this, what is this going to equal? So when you first look at this, you say, \"Oh, I have different denominators here. It's not obvious how I add these.\" And you'd be right and the way to actually move forward is to find a common denominator, to convert both of these fractions into fractions that have a common denominator. So how do you think about a common denominator? Well, a common denominator's gonna have to be a common multiple of these two denominators of 10 and six. So what's a common multiple of 10 and six? And it's usually simplest to find the least common multiple, and a good way of doing that is start with the larger denominator here, 10, and say, okay is 10 divisible by six? No. Okay, now, is 20 divisible by six? No. Is 30 divisible by six? Yes. 30 is divisible by six. So I'm just going through the multiples of 10 and saying, \"Well what is the smallest multiple of 10 that is divisible by six?\" And that's going to be 30. So I could rewrite both of these fractions as something over 30. So nine over 10. How would I write that as something over 30? Well I multiply the denominator, I'm multiplying the denominator by three. So I've just multiplied the denominator by three. So if I don't want to change the value of the fraction, I have to do the same thing to the numerator. I have to multiply that by three as well because now I'm just multiplying the numerator by three and the denominator by three, and that doesn't change the value of the fraction. So nine times three is 27. So once again, 9/10 and 27/30 represent the same number. I've just written it now with a denominator of 30, and that's useful because I can also write 1/6 with a denominator of 30. Let's do that. So 1/6 is what over 30? I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it. So what did we do go from six to 30? We had to multiply by five. So if we multiply the denominator by five, we have to multiply the numerator by five as well, so one times five, one times five is five. So 9/10 is the same thing as 27/30, and 1/6 is the same thing as 5/30. And now we can add, now we can add and it's fairly straightforward. We have a certain number of 30ths, added to another number of 30ths, so 27/30 + 5/30, well that's going to be 27, that's going to be 27 plus five, plus five, plus 5/30, plus 5/30, which of course going to be equal to 32/30. 32 over 30, and if we want, we could try to reduce this fraction. We have a common factor of 32 and 30, they're both divisible by two. So if we divide the numerator and the denominator by two, numerator divided by two is 16, denominator divided by two is 15. So, this is the same thing as 16/15, and if I wanted to write this as a mixed number, 15 goes into 16 one time with a remainder one. So this is the same thing as 1 1/15. Let's do another example. Let's say that we wanted to add, we wanted to add 1/2 to to 11/12, to 11 over 12. And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you could work this out. Well like we saw before, we wanna find a common denominator. If these had the same denominator, we could just add them immediately, but we wanna find a common denominator because right now they're not the same. Well what we wanna find is a multiple, a common multiple of two and 12, and ideally we'll find the lowest common multiple of two and 12, and just like we did before, let's start with the larger of the two numbers, 12. Now we could just say well 12 times one is 12, so that we could view that as the lowest multiple of 12. And is that divisible by two? Yeah, sure. 12 is divisible by two. So 12 is actually the least common multiple of two and 12, so we could write both of these fractions as something over 12. So 1/2 is what over 12? Well to go from two to 12, you multiply by six, so we'll also multiply the numerator by six. Now we see 1/2, and 6/12, these are the same thing. One is half of two, six is half of 12. And how would we write 11/12 as something over 12? Well it's already written as something over 12, 11/12 already has 12 in the denominator, so we don't have to change that. 11/12, and now we're ready to add. So this is going to be equal to six, this is going to be equal to six plus 11, six plus 11 over 12. Over 12. We have 6/12 plus 11/12, it's gonna be six plus 11 over 12, which is equal to, six plus 11 is 17/12. If we wanted to write it as a mixed number, that is what, 12 goes into 17 one time with a remainder of five, so 1 5/12. Let's do one more of these. This is strangely fun. Alright. Let's say that we wanted to add, We're gonna add 3/4 to, we're gonna add 3/4 to 1/5. To one over five. What is this going to be? And once again, pause the video and see if you could work it out. Well we have different denominators here, and we wanna find, we wanna rewrite these so they have the same denominators, so we have to find a common multiple, ideally the least common multiple. So what's the least common multiple of four and five? Well let's start with the larger number, and let's look at its multiples and keep increasing them until we get one that's divisible by four. So five is not divisible by four. 10 is not divisible by four, or perfectly divisible by four is what we care about. 15 is not perfectly divisible by four. 20 is divisible by four, in fact, that is five times four. That is 20. So what we could do is, we could write both of these fractions as having 20 in the denominator, or 20 as the denominator. So we could write 3/4 is something over 20. So to go from four to 20 in the denominator, we multiplied by five. So we also do that to the numerator. We multiply by three times five to get 15. All I did to go from four to 20, multiplied by five. So I have to do the same thing to the numerator, three times five is 15. 3/4 is the same thing as 15/20, and over here. 1/5. What is that over 20? Well to go from five to 20, you have to multiply by four. So we have to do the same thing to the numerator. I have to multiply this numerator times four to get 4/20. So now I've rewritten this instead of 3/4 plus 1/5, it's now written as 15/20 plus 4/20. And what is that going to be? Well that's going to be 15 plus four is 19/20. 19/20, and we're done.",

In this case, the 8 is divisible by 4, (8/4 = 2), so you're going to multiply the smaller one (4) by 2, bringing it to 8. Now, you have to remember, whenever you scale fractions, you have to multiply both, so now it's 6/8+3/8 = 9/8 = 1 1/8. In other cases where the larger denominator isn't divisible by the smaller one, find the LCM (least/smallest common multiple), and scale both fractions so the denominators are equal.

We can easily think of an improper fraction as a mixed number, right? We have a whole number plus a fractional number.

As with any unlike denominator adding/subtracting problem, you have to get the fractions to the same denominator. In this case, it would be a denominator of 15.\n= 6 + 10/15 + 9/15\n= 6 + 19/15\n= 6 + 1 + 4/15\n= 7 4/15, or 109/15"

I just don't want to ignore it just in case there are situations where it needs to be used which I find is always the case that there are rules that work for some combination of things and not others.\n\nThe book I am reading has stumped me in the addition of fractions. Here is a snippet of it:\n\n1/7 + 3/4\n\n\"Here, we can neither convert sevenths to quarters nor quarters to sevenths, so we\u2019re going to learn a method that you can use to add or subtract any fractions. To get identical bottom numbers, we begin by multiplying each number by 1, written as quarters in one case, and as sevenths in the other.\"\n\n1x 1/7 + 1x3/4 = 4/4 x 1/7 + 7/7 x 3/4\n\nI have no idea how they got the 4/4 and 7/7 try as I might and how the strange-looking order of the terms after the equal sign even if I overlooked how they got those numbers to begin with.\n\nI thought I worked out how they did it but my brain refused to accept what it thought was either a convoluted approach or that I was creating my own incorrect method lol\n\nCan anyone provide a possible clarification of why they would suggest using this method rather than the easy cross multiplication method?",
                "a": "Some basic info you need to know:\n\n1) The denominator of a fraction tells you the size of each portion. Visualize a pizze that was cut into 8 slice. Each slice is 1/8 of the pizza. If a pizza is cut int 4 slices, then each slice is 1/4 of the pizza and a slice is twice as big as a slice of 1/8\n\n2) To add & subtract fractions we need to work with fractions of the same size. So, we have to force the denominators to have a common value. This is called a \"common denominator\".\n\n3) Equivalent fractions are created by multiplying both numerator & denominator by the same value. Why? This is based upon the identity property of multiplication: Any number times 1 = the original number. So, by multiplying a fraction by 4/4 = 1, we aren't changing the value of the fraction. We're just converting it to an equivalent value.\n\nNow to your questions - Where did the 4/4 and 7/7 come from?\n\nSince the fractions in the video don't have a common denominator, they need to be converted to have a common denominator. So, we start by find the lowest common multiple(LCM), also called the lowest common denominator (LCD) of the fractions. The LCM for 4 and 7 is 28. There are lessons on finding an LCM at: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-factors-multiples/pre-algebra-lcm/v/least-common-multiple-exercise\n\nTo convert the fraction 1/7 to have a denominator of 28, you ask yourself the question: what times 7 will create 28? The answer is 4. You do the same thing to determine how to convert 3/4 to have a denominator of 28. What times 4 will create a denominator of 28? The answer is 7. These values 4 and 7 become 4/4 and 7/7 because we have to multiply each fraction by a value = 1 to have an equivalent fraction.\n\nHope this helps."

        "transcript": "- [VOICEOVER] Let's see if we can figure out what 4/3 minus 1/5 is, and if you think you know how to do it, I encourage you to pause the video and give it a go. So, when you first look at this, the thing that might jump out at you is we have different denominators here. So, it's not obvious how to subtract 1/5 from 4/3 when you have these different denominators and the key is, is to rewrite each of these fractions so that they have the same denominator. And how do we figure out what that same denominator is? Well, it's going to be a common multiple of three and five, and, ideally, it's going to be the least common multiple of three and five. So, how can we calculate that? Well, we can start with the larger of the two numbers, say five, and let's go through it's multiples and see when we get to one that's divisible perfectly by three. So, five is not divisible by three, 10 is not divisible by three, 15 is divisible by three. In fact, 15 is three times five. So, I can rewrite both of these fractions as something over 15. So, what's 4/3 if I were to rewrite it as something over 15? Well, to get from three to 15 in the denominator, we have to multiply by five. So, if you multiply the denominator by five, if you don't want to change the value of the fraction, you have to multiply the numerator by five as well. So, you have to multiply the numerator by five as well, four times five is going to be 20. So, 4/3 is the same thing as 20/15. Alright. Now, how would we rewrite 1/5 and something over 15? So, we're going to have 15 in the denominator. Well, to go from five to 15, we had to multiply by three. So, if we multiply the denominator by three, we have to multiply the numerator by three as well. So, times three. One times three is just three. So, 4/3 minus 1/5, we can rewrite that as 20/15 minus 3/15. Now, this becomes a lot more straight forward. What is this going to be? Well, this is going to be a certain number of fifteenths. We have 20/15 and we're taking away three of those fifteenths. So, we are going to have, if you have 20 of something and you take away three of them, you're going to have 17 of those things. In this case, we're talking about fifteenths. So, this is going to be 17/15. And if we wanted to write it as a mixed number, we could say 15 goes into 17 one time with a remainder of two. So, it's one and 2/15. Let's do another example. Let's see if we can figure out what 7/10 minus 5/8 is. Five over eight. And I encourage you to pause this video and see if you can calculate it yourself. Well, just like we saw before, we have different denominators but we need to rewrite them so they have a common denominator, that way, we can subtract. And so, what's a common multiple of 10 and eight and, ideally, the least common multiple. It doesn't have to be but it keeps things a little bit simpler. Well, let's start with the larger of the two numbers and then keep finding in their multiples and find one that is perfectly divisible by the other one, by eight. So, ten isn't perfectly divisible by eight, 20 isn't, 30 isn't, 40 is. 40 is a multiple of 10 and it's a multiple of eight. In fact, it's the least common multiple of 10 and eight. So, we can rewrite both of these fractions as something over 40. So, that's going to be something over 40 minus something over 40. Minus something over 40 is equal to something. So, 7/10 is what over 40? Well, to go from 10 to 40 in the denominator, we multiplied by four. So, we have to do the same thing in the numerator, multiply the numerator by four. Seven times four is 28. So, 7/10 is the same thing as 28/40. Now, let's do the same thing with the other fraction. To go from eight to 40 in the denominator, we had to multiply the denominator by five. Eight times five is 40. So, if we multiply the denominator by five, we have to multiply the numerator by five as well. Five times five is 25. So, 7/10 minus 5/8 is the exact same things as 28/40 minus 25/40 and now this makes a lot of sense. It's going to be a certain number of fortieths. If I have 28/40 and I take away 25 of those fortieths, how many fortieths am I going to have left? Well, I'm going to 3/40 left. 28/40 minus 25/40. So, I'm going to have 3/40. 28 minus 25 is three and we are done. 7/10 minus 5/8 is 3/40.",

Then, you would have to multiply the numerators by the number you multiplied their denominator to get the common multiple.

        "transcript": "Cindy and Michael need 1 gallon of orange paint for the giant cardboard pumpkin they are making for Halloween. Cindy has 2/5 of a gallon of red paint. Michael has got 1/2 a gallon of yellow paint. If they mix their paints together, will they have the 1 gallon they need? So let's think about that. We're going to add the 2/5 of a gallon of red paint, and we're going to add that to 1/2 a gallon of yellow paint. And we want to see if this gets to being 1 whole gallon. So whenever we add fractions, right over here we're not adding the same thing. Here we're adding 2/5. Here we're adding 1/2. So in order to be able to add these two things, we need to get to a common denominator. And the common denominator, or the best common denominator to use, is the number that is the smallest multiple of both 5 and 2. And since 5 and 2 are both prime numbers, the smallest number's just going to be their product. 10 is the smallest number that we can think of that is divisible by both 5 and 2. So let's rewrite each of these fractions with 10 as the denominator. So 2/5 is going to be something over 10, and 1/2 is going to be something over 10. And to help us visualize this, let me draw a grid. Let me draw a grid with tenths in it. So, that's that, and that's that right over here. So each of these are in tenths. These are 10 equal segments this bar is divided into. So let's try to visualize what 2/5 looks like on this bar. Well, right now it's divided into tenths. If we were to divide this bar into fifths, then we're going to have-- actually, let me do it in that same color. So it's going to be, this is 1 division, 2, 3, 4. So notice if you go between the red marks, these are each a fifth of the bar. And we have two of them, so we're going to go 1 and 2. This right over here, this part of the bar, represents 2/5 of it. Now let's do the same thing for 1/2. So let's divide this bar exactly in half. So, let me do that. I'm going to divide it exactly in half. And 1/2 literally represents 1 of the 2 equal sections. So this is one 1/2. Now, to go from fifths to tenths, you're essentially taking each of the equal sections and you're multiplying by 2. You had 5 equals sections. You split each of those into 2, so you have twice as many. You now have 10 equal sections. So those 2 sections that were shaded in, well, you are going to multiply by 2 the same way. Those 2 are going to turn into 4/10. And you see it right over here when we shaded it initially. If you Look at the tenths, you have 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, and 4/10. Let's do the same logic over here. If you have 2 halves and you want to make them into 10 tenths, you have to take each of the halves and split them into 5 sections. You're going to have 5 times as many sections. So to go from 2 to 10, we multiply by 5. So, similarly, that one shaded-in section in yellow, that 1/2 is going to turn into 5/10. So we're going to multiply by 5. Another way to think about it. Whatever we did to the denominator, we had to do the numerator. Otherwise, somehow we're changing the value of the fraction. So, 1 times 5 is going to get you to 5. And you see that over here when we shaded it in, that 1/2, if you look at the tenths, is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 tenths. And now we are ready to add. Now we are ready to add these two things. 4/10 plus 5/10, well, this is going to be equal to a certain number of tenths. It's going to be equal to a certain number of tenths. It's going to be equal to 4 plus 5 tenths. And we can once again visualize that. Let me draw our grid again. So 4 plus 5/10, I'll do it actually on top of the paint can right over here. So let me color in 4/10. So 1, 2, 3, 4. And then let me color in the 5/10. And notice that was exactly the 4/10 here, which is exactly the 2/5. Let me color in the 5/10-- 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. And so how many total tenths do we have? We have a total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 9 of the tenths are now shaded in. We had 9/10 of a gallon of paint. So now to answer their question, will they have the gallon they need? No, they have less than a whole. A gallon would be 10 tenths. They only have 9 tenths. So no, they do not have enough of a gallon. Now, another way you could have thought about this, you could have said, hey, look, 2/5 is less than 1/2, and you could even visualize that right over here. So if I have something less than 1/2 plus 1/2, I'm not going to get a whole. So either way you could think about it, but this way at least we can think it through with actually adding the fractions.",

If we were to divide this bar into fifths, then we're going to have-- actually, let me do it in that same color. So it's going to be, this is 1 division, 2, 3, 4. So notice if you go between the red marks, these are each a fifth of the bar. And we have two of them, so we're going to go 1 and 2. This right over here, this part of the bar, represents 2/5 of it. Now let's do the same thing for 1/2. So let's divide this bar exactly in half. So, let me do that. I'm going to divide it exactly in half. And 1/2 literally represents 1 of the 2 equal sections.

If you have 2 halves and you want to make them into 10 tenths, you have to take each of the halves and split them into 5 sections. You're going to have 5 times as many sections. So to go from 2 to 10, we multiply by 5. So, similarly, that one shaded-in section in yellow, that 1/2 is going to turn into 5/10. So we're going to multiply by 5. Another way to think about it. Whatever we did to the denominator, we had to do the numerator. Otherwise, somehow we're changing the value of the fraction. So, 1 times 5 is going to get you to 5. And you see that over here when we shaded it in, that 1/2, if you look at the tenths, is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 tenths. And now we are ready to add. Now we are ready to add these two things. 4/10 plus 5/10, well, this is going to be equal to a certain number of tenths. It's going to be equal to a certain number of tenths. It's going to be equal to 4 plus 5 tenths. And we can once again visualize that. Let me draw our grid again. So 4 plus 5/10, I'll do it actually on top of the paint can right over here. So let me color in 4/10. So 1, 2, 3, 4. And then let me color in the 5/10. And notice that was exactly the 4/10 here, which is exactly the 2/5. Let me color in the 5/10-- 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. And so how many total tenths do we have? We have a total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 9 of the tenths are now shaded in. We had 9/10 of a gallon of paint. So now to answer their question, will they have the gallon they need? No, they have less than a whole. A gallon would be 10 tenths. They only have 9 tenths. So no, they do not have enough of a gallon. Now, another way you could have thought about this, you could have said, hey, look, 2/5 is less than 1/2, and you could even visualize that right over here. So if I have something less than 1/2 plus 1/2, I'm not going to get a whole. So either way you could think about it, but this way at least we can think it through with actually adding the fractions.\"",

        "transcript": "Silvia is growing tomato plants and studying their heights. Here is her data. So the beefsteak tomato type had a height of 3 and 1/4 feet, Roma 2 and 7/8 feet, cherry 3 and 1/2 feet. And they ask us, what is the difference between the heights of the beefsteak, so that's that one right over there, and the Roma tomato plants? So they want us to find the distance between these two heights. So this cherry tomato height was really unnecessary for the sake of this problem. So we want to find the difference in these two heights. So we want to subtract the smaller of these from the larger of these. So we're really trying to evaluate what 3 and 1/4 minus 2 and 7/8 is. Now, the first thing that I like to do is convert both of these into mixed numbers. Sorry, they're already mixed numbers-- to convert both of these into improper fractions. So 3 and 1/4 is the same thing as 3 plus 1/4, which is the same thing as 12/4 plus 1/4. That's the same thing as 3 and 1/4. And from that, we're going to subtract 2 and 7/8. 2 and 7/8 is the same thing as 2 plus 7/8. 2 is the same thing as 16/8 plus 7/8. So this is essentially what we are trying to figure out. Now, what is 12/4 plus 1/4? It's 13/4, 13 over 4. And then, what's 16/8 plus 7/8? Well, that's 23/8. So this is going to be minus 23 over eight. Now, we're subtracting one fraction from another. But we have different denominators. So we can't make sense of this until we have the same denominator. And so what is the least common multiple of these two denominators, of both 4 and 8? What is the smallest number that is divisible by both 4 and 8? Well, 8 is divisible by 8. And 8 is also divisible by 4. So if we can rewrite 13/4 as having 8 as a denominator, then we are all set. So let's try to do that. So we're going to write both of these with 8 as the denominator. This one already has it. So 13/4, I'm going to have it with 8 as the denominator. So to get from 4 to 8, we have to multiply the denominator by 2. So in order to not change the value of the fraction, we have to multiply the numerator by that exact same value. We've got to multiply it by 2. So this becomes 26/8. And from 26/8, we're going to subtract 23/8. And so this is going to be over 8-- 26 minus 23, which is equal to, and we deserve our drum roll now, is 3. So it's 3/8. So the difference between the heights of the beefsteak and Roma tomato plants-- 3/8. And everything we've been doing insofar has been in feet, so 3/8 of a foot.",

        "transcript": "Let's think about what fraction of this grid is actually shaded in pink. So the first thing we want to think about is how many equal sections do we have here? Well, this is a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 by 1, 2, 3 grid. So there's 15 sections here. You could also count it-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. So there are 15 equal sections here. And how many of those equal sections are actually shaded in this kind of pinkish color? Well, We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So it's 6/15 is shaded in. But I want to simplify this more. I have a feeling that there's some equivalent fractions that represent the exact same thing as 6/15. And to get a sense of that, let me redraw this a little bit, where I still shade in six of these rectangles, but I'll shade them a little bit in one chunk. So let me throw in another grid right over here, and let me attempt to shade in the rectangles as fast as possible. So that is 1-- 1 rectangle. I'll even make my thing even bigger. All right, 1 rectangle, 2 rectangles, 3 rectangles-- halfway there-- 4 rectangles, 5 rectangles shaded in and now 6 rectangles shaded in. So this right over here, what I just did, this is still 6 rectangles of the 15 rectangles are shaded in. So this is still 6/15. These are representing the same thing. But how can I simplify this even more? Well, when you look at it numerically, you see that both 6 and 15 are divisible by 3. In fact, their greatest common factor is 3. So what happens if we divide the numerator and denominator by 3? If we do the same thing to the numerator and the denominator, we're not going to be changing the value of the fraction. So let's divide the numerator by 3 and divide the denominator by 3. And what do we get? We get 2 over 5. Now how does this make sense in the context of this diagram right here? Well, we started off with 6 shaded in. You divide by 3, you have 2 shaded in. So you're essentially saying, hey, let's group these into sections of 3. So let's say that this right over here is one section of 3. This is one section of 3 right over here. So that's one section of 3. And then this is another section of 3 right over here. And so you have two sections of 3. And actually let me color it in a little bit better. So you have two sections of 3. And if you were to combine them, it looks just like this. Notice this is covering the exact same area as your 6 smaller ones did. And then how many equal sections of this size do you have on this entire thing? Well, you have 5 equal sections. Because this is one section of 3 right over here, this is another section of 3. And then this is another section of 3. So notice, you're covering the exact same area of the original thing. You're covering 2 out of the 5 equal sections. So 2/5 and 6/15 are equivalent fractions. So if you want to say what fraction of this is covered in the simplest form, you would say 2/5.",

So we have all agreed (about 1,500 years ago) to label a bag with three quarters, 3/4. The count goes on the top (or on the left) and the denomination, the number of pieces the whole was cut into (the denominator) goes on the bottom (or the right)."

And 7/9 you could represent as 7 of those equal sections. So let me get myself a bigger thing to draw with, so that I can fill this in fast. Actually, I don't like how that looks. I'm going to use the paint brush. So here we go. So that's 1, 2, 3, 4-- you know where this is going-- 5, 6, and 7. So that's one way of representing 7/9. We already know that. That's not too interesting. But let's see if we can represent 7/9 as the sum of other fractions. So let's imagine maybe we can represent it as-- let's do it as 2/9. Let me use a different brush here. So let's represent it as 2/9. 2/9 plus-- I don't know, let's see, maybe 3/9. But that doesn't quite get us to 7/9 yet. 2/9 plus 3/9 is going to get us to 5/9. So we're going to need 2 more. So it's going to be plus another 2/9. So what would this look like? So let's just draw another grid here. So this is going to look like-- and I'll try to do it right below it, so that we can see how they match up. So we have 2/9, this 2/9 right over here. Well, we have each of these as a ninth. We have 9 equal sections. So we're going to get 1 and 2. And then we're going to add 3 more ninths. So 1, 2, 3. So we add 3/9 right over there and then 2 more ninths, 1 and 2. So notice, when I added 2/9 to 3/9 to 2/9, this equals 7/9. And we know that when we add a bunch of fractions like this that have the same denominator, we can just add the numerator. And this is why. This is 2/9 plus 3/9 times 2/9 is going to give me 7/9. Let's do this one more time. This is actually a lot of fun. So let me draw my grid again. And then let's see what we can do.

And maybe we could add 3/9. And then we could add, let's see-- actually, let me just write this out. I'm going to try to add four fractions here. So let's say add first 1/9 and see where that gets us. So 1/9 is going to get us right over here. So that's 1/9. So let's say we add 2/9 to that. I've got my little paint brush going on. So that's 1 and 2 more, 2/9. So that still doesn't get us there. This gives us a total of 3/9. 1 plus 2 is 3-- 3/9. So let's add 4/9. And I'll do that in this blue color. So 4/9. That's different enough. So let's see where this gets us. Actually, well, why not? So 4/9. And so that's going to get us 1, 2, 3, 4.

So we could call this one right over here 0/9. And how would we visualize that? Well, we're saying none of these. No ninths right over here. So this is 1/9 plus 2/9 plus 4/9 is equal to 7/9.

To convert a fraction into a different denominator, you have to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number (in order to keep the actual value the same). The easiest way to convert two fractions to the same denominator is to make each denominator the least common multiple of the two previous denominators. With all that out of the way, let's see that example:\n3/9 + 2/6\nThe least common multiple between 9 and 6 is 18 (you can learn how to find LCMs by using the search box in the top of any Khan Academy screen, if you don't know already). So, we multiply each fraction to get 18\n3/9 * 2/2 = 6/18\n2/6 * 3/3 = 6/18\nNow, you have two fractions with the same denominator, so you can add them as normal:\n6/18 + 6/18 = (6 + 6) / 18 = 12/18 = 2/3\nSo, your final simplified answer is 2/3\n(Note: you could have made the problem lots easier by simplifying the fractions at the beginning into 1/3 and 1/3 and then just adding those, but that would defeat the purpose of learning how to add unlike denominators.)"

        "transcript": "- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can calculate what 5/6 plus 1/4 is, and to help us, I have a visual representation of 5/6, and a visual representation of 1/4. Notice I have this whole whole, I guess you could say, broken up into one, two, three, four, five, six sections, and we've shaded in five of them, so this is 5/6, and then down here, we have another whole, and we have one out of the four equal sections shaded in so this is 1/4, and I want to add them, and I encourage you at any point, pause the video, and see if you could figure it out on your own. Well, whenever we're adding fractions, we like to think in terms of fractions that have the same denominator, and these clearly don't have the same denominator, but in order to rewrite them, with a common denominator, we just have to think of a common multiple of six and four, and ideally, the smallest common multiple of six and four, and the way that I like to do that is I like to take the larger of the two, which is six, and then think about its multiples. So I could first think about six itself. Six is clearly divisible by six, but it's not perfectly divisible by four, so now, let's multiply by two, so then we get to 12. 12 is divisible by both six and four. So 12 is a good common denominator here. It's the least common multiple of six and four. So we can rewrite both of these fractions as something over 12. So, something over 12 plus something, plus something over 12 is equal to. Now, there's a bunch of ways to tackle it, but what I want to do is I just want to visualize it here on this drawing. So, if I go, if I were to go from, if I were to go from six equal sections to 12 equal sections, which is what I'm doing if I'm going from six in the denominator to 12 in the denominator. I'm essentially multiplying each of these sections by, or, I'm essentially multiplying the number of sections I have by two, or I'm taking each of these existing sections and I'm turning them into two sections, so let's do that. Let's do that. Let me see if I can do it pretty neatly, so, I can do it a little bit neater than that. So, it'll look like that. And, whoops. Let me do this one. I want to divide them fairly close to evenly. I'm doing it by eye so it's not going to be perfect. So, and you have that one. And then last not, last but not least, you have that one there, and then notice, I had six sections, but now I've doubled the number of sections. I've turned the six sections into 12 sections by turning each of the original six into two, so now I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 sections. So if I have 12 sections now, how many of those 12 are now shaded in? Instead of having five of the six, I now have 10 of the 12 that are shaded in. So I now have 10/12. 5/6 is the same thing as 10/12. Another way you could have thought about that, to go from six to 12, I had to multiply by two, so then I have to do the same thing in the numerator. Five times two is 10. But hopefully you see that those two fractions are equivalent, that I didn't change how much is shaded in, I just took each of the original six and I turned it into two, or I multiplied the total number of sections by two to get 12, and then instead of having 5/6, I now have 10/12 shaded in. Now let's do the same thing with the four, with the 1/4. Right here, I've depicted 1/4, but I want to turn this into something over 12. So to turn it into something over 12, each section has to be turned into three sections. So let's do that. Let's turn each section into three sections. So, that's one, two, and three. So then I have one, two, and three. I have, I think you can see where this is going. One, two and three. I have one, two, and three. And so notice, all I did is I multiplied, before I had four equal sections. Now I turned each of those four sections into three sections, so now I have 12 equal sections. And I did that, essentially, by multiplying the number of sections I had by three. So now what fraction is shaded in? Well, now, this original that was one out of the four, we can now see is three out of the 12 equal sections. It's now three out of the 12 equal sections, and so what is this going to be? Well, if I have 10/12, and I'm adding it to 3/12, well how many twelfths do I have? I'm going to have 13/12. And you could see it visually over here as well. Up here in green, I have 10/12 shaded in. Each of these boxes are a twelfth. Let me write that down. Each of these boxes are 1/12. That's 1/12. This is 1/12. So how many twelfths do I have shaded in? I have the 10 that are shaded in in green, and then I have an 11/12, a 12/12 and then finally, the 13/12 is one way to think about it.",

                "a": "The first thing you would have to do is to change all of the denominators to a common denominator. To do this, find the lowest number that is divisible by all of your denominators. In this case, that number would be 100.\n\nThen look at the numerator. To make sure that the fractions are still the same value, we need to change the numerator by the same amount we changed the denominator. So:\n\n4 goes into 100 25 times. That means we need to also multiply the numerator by 25. That means that we now have 25/100 instead of 1/4. That means that 1/4 and 25/100 are the same value. We now do this for the other fractions.\n\n5 goes into 100 20 times. So in this case we multiply the numerator by 20. 20 multiplied by 3 is 60. So instead of 3/5 we now have 60/100.\n\nFinally, you need to do the last fraction. 10 goes into 100 10 times. So we need to do 3 multiplied by 10. Then we would get 30/100.\n\nThe last thing you have to do is add the numerators back together. Our denominators are now the same, so the new problem is this:\n\n25/100 + 60/100 +30/100\n\nThen we add the numerators, so we do 25+60+30. This comes out to be 115.\n\nSo our answer would be 115/100. But this is an improper fraction, so we could also change it into 1 and 15/100, because 100/100 is equal to one.\n\nTo simplify it, then we change it to 3/20 by dividing both 15 and 100 by 5.\n\nOur final answer would be 1 and 3/20.

For example, to add 1/2 + 1/3, we need to get the denominators (the bottom numbers) to be the same. To do this, we find whats called the \"least common denominator\". An easy way to do this is to simply multiply those two denominators (2 and 3) and notice what you had to multiply each denominator by to get those numbers. So the denominator 2 had to be multiplied by 3 to get 6, and the denominator 3 had to multiplied by 2 to get 6. So we do the same with the top numbers. In this case, they are both 1 (1/2 +1/3) so the answer is 3/6 + 2/6 which is equal to 5/6.
